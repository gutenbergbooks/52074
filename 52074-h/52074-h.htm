<h2>EDITOR&#8217;S PREFACE</h2>

<p>This handbook, which explains in detail a variety of
processes common to general metalworking, has been
written by a number of thoroughly practical men, by
whom it was contributed in another form to &#8220;Work,&#8221;
the illustrated weekly journal of handicrafts and
mechanics. Its appeal is to everybody who makes any
attempt at working in metals, inasmuch as at least
one of the processes&mdash;soldering, brazing or welding&mdash;will
be met at a very early stage in the
beginner&#8217;s experience. This handbook will be found
a complete workshop guide to the usual methods of
soldering and brazing, and will form an excellent
introduction to the modern electrical and oxy-acetylene
welding processes, to do complete justice to which,
however, a separate handbook would, of course, be
necessary. If readers encounter difficulty in any of
the matters treated in this book, they have only to
write to &#8220;Work,&#8221; in whose columns (but not by
post) help will be willingly afforded.</p>

<h2><span class="chapno">CHAPTER I</span><br />
<span class="chaptitle">The Various Processes of Joining Metals</span></h2>

<p>Apart from the use of rivets, screws, etc., metal is
commonly joined by soldering, brazing, or welding,
three groups of processes that have one thing in common&mdash;the
use of heat to fuse either the metals themselves
or an alloy which is interposed to consolidate
the joint. The word &#8220;solder&#8221; is derived through
the French from a Latin word meaning &#8220;solid.&#8221;</p>

<p>Soldering may be &#8220;soft&#8221; or &#8220;hard.&#8221; Soft-soldering
uses lead-tin alloys which are easily melted in a
bunsen gas flame or with a hot iron or bit; while hard-soldering
employs a silver-copper alloy, to melt which
a mouth blowpipe at least is necessary. Brazing is
hard-soldering with spelter (brass), and a forge or a
heavy blowlamp or a powerful blowpipe must be
employed to provide the heat.</p>

<p>Welding is a fusion process which in the past was
almost entirely confined to wrought-iron and steel,
these metals possessing the property of weldability to
an extent unknown in the case of any other metals.<span class="pagenum" id="Page2">[2]</span>
The blacksmith&#8217;s process of welding is to heat the iron
or steel until the surface of the metal becomes pasty,
and then to bring the two pieces into intimate contact
by hammering on the anvil. Of late years the welding
of iron, steel, copper and some other metals has
been rendered possible by the use of certain electrical
and chemical methods and&mdash;most important of all&mdash;by
the use of the oxy-acetylene blowpipe, the process being
known as &#8220;fusion welding&#8221; or &#8220;autogenous soldering,&#8221;
the word autogenous implying that the process is complete
in itself and independent of the use of any
extraneous substance such as solder. The thermit
process, of which so much has been heard, and which
is briefly dealt with <a href="#Ref01">later</a>, is the fusion welding of
iron and steel by means of the intense heat produced
by the combustion of a special chemical compound.
Perhaps the oldest of the autogenous soldering processes
is &#8220;lead-burning,&#8221; in which the flame of an airo-hydrogen
blowpipe is brought to bear upon the lead,
the joint being fed with a strip of the same metal.</p>

<p>Soft-soldering is an operation that the beginner will
not find nearly so difficult as hard-soldering or brazing,
and although the strength of joints made by it is not
nearly equal to that produced by the methods named,
it fills a useful place within its scope. It is purely a
surface union&mdash;that is, the solder adheres to the faces
in contact in much the same manner as an adhesive
sticks to metal; but with the assistance of fluxes, the
contact is made so intimate that some force is necessary
to break the joint. Soft-soldering is also of use where<span class="pagenum" id="Page3">[3]</span>
brazing would simply mean the ruin or destruction of
the metals, as in the cases of lead, poor-quality brass,
pewter, tin, zinc, and in tinplate and galvanised iron.</p>

<p>In silver-soldering and brazing, the silver or spelter
that fuses to form the joint alloys itself so intimately
with the copper or brass that it actually becomes part
of the piece itself, and for all practical purposes
cannot be distinguished from it. But soft-soldering
is not always inferior to hard-soldering. Indeed,
the surface nature of the soldering often constitutes
its value.</p>

<p>The strongest joints of all are produced by fusion
welding, as will be duly understood from later chapters.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page4">[4]</span></p>

<h2><span class="chapno">CHAPTER II</span><br />
<span class="chaptitle">Soft Solders</span></h2>

<p>A solder should melt at a slightly lower temperature
than the metals which it unites, and should possess the
quality of alloying with the two surfaces, thus effecting
a sound and true metallic joint. Ordinary soft solders
are lead-tin alloys, and the larger the proportion of lead
the commoner is the solder said to be. At an extreme
is plumber&#8217;s solder, consisting of 2 parts of lead to 1
part of tin, and, at the other, the best blowpipe soft
solder, which contains 2 parts of tin to only 1 part of
lead. In the ordinary way, a &#8220;coarse&#8221; or &#8220;common&#8221;
solder is 2 parts of lead to 1 part of tin; a &#8220;fine&#8221; or
&#8220;medium&#8221; solder, 1 part of lead to 1 part of tin; and
a &#8220;very fine&#8221; or &#8220;best&#8221; solder, 1 part of lead to 2
parts of tin.</p>

<h3>Eutectic Alloys.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;Lead-tin solders are eutectic
alloys&mdash;that is, they are examples of the phenomenon of
a combination of two metals melting at a temperature
lower than one of them would if melted separately.
Thus, lead melts at about 328&deg; C., and tin at about
232&deg; C., yet reference to the following table, given by
Mr. A. H. Hiorns, will show that the &#8220;commonest&#8221;
solder mentioned fuses at 303&deg; C., and the &#8220;best&#8221; at
175&deg; C.</p>

<h3>Hardness of Solders.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;According to the before-mentioned

<p>These results, says Mr. Hiorns, show that the
hardest alloy is the one with 66% (about 2 parts) of tin
and 34% (about 1 part) of lead, which also is the one
having the lowest melting point of all the lead-tin
alloys. The results also show that tin is slightly harder
than lead.</p>

<h3>Compositions of Soft Solders.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;As already shown,
solders vary in fusibility according to their composition,
and the choice should be determined by the nature of<span class="pagenum" id="Page6">[6]</span>
the work and the properties of the metal to be soldered.
Should a solder be used of too high a melting-point, the
metal will itself be fused before the solder begins to
flow.</p>

<p>A point to be particularly observed is that the introduction
of a foreign substance into the solder&mdash;for
example, the addition of a little zinc to a pot of &#8220;very
fine&#8221; solder&mdash;will utterly spoil it and render it unworkable.
To remove zinc from solder, melt the
solder in a pot, take it off the fire and stir in powdered
sulphur or brimstone until the whole is of the consistency
of wet sand. Replace the pot on the fire and
melt, but do not stir the contents. The sulphur and
zinc will rise to the surface and form into a cake.
Now take the pot off the fire and carefully remove the
cake without breaking by employing two pieces of
hoop iron with bent ends.</p>

<p>It is false economy to use a rough solder for fine
work on the score of cheapness, since more solder is
required for a given job on account of the rough
particles of solder clinging to the work; moreover, the
rough appearance of the soldering may completely spoil
the job.</p>

<p>The <a href="#Ref02">table</a> on the opposite page gives the fluxes and
the compositions of soft solders suited to a number of
different metals.</p>

<h3>Making Solder Strips, Wire, Tears, etc.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;Only
clean, pure tin and pure lead should be employed.
The lead is first melted and then the tin added. When
all is melted, place a piece of resin on the molten<span class="pagenum" id="Page7">[7]</span>
metal to act as a flux, and after well stirring, the solder
is made into strips by pouring from a ladle. Solder
should not be poured into sand. It may be poured
into strips on an oiled sheet of black iron, preferably
corrugated to accommodate the strips. In the absence
of a corrugated iron sheet, some workers use a ladle
resembling a large spoon with a hole about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> in. in
diameter near the end. To form the strips, get a
ladle full of solder, place it on a flat iron sheet; then,
tilting the ladle to allow the solder to flow over the
hole, quickly draw the ladle across the sheet. A thin<span class="pagenum" id="Page8">[8]</span>
strip of solder should thus be formed, and the thickness
of the strip may be varied by increasing or
decreasing the diameter of the hole in the ladle. A
button of solder usually forms at one or both ends of
the strip, and this excess should be melted off the
strips by just dipping the ends into the molten solder
in the pot.</p>

<p>Solder wire is very handy for small work, and can
be made in the following way: Roll a sheet of stiff
writing or drawing paper into a conical form, rather
broad in comparison with its length; make a ring of
stiff wire to hold it in, attaching a suitable handle to
the ring. The point of the cone should first of all be
cut off to leave an orifice of the size required. It
should then be filled with molten solder, and held above
a pail of cold water, and the stream of solder flowing
from the cone will solidify as it runs and form the wire.
If held a little higher, so that the stream of solder
breaks into drops before striking the water, it will
form handy elongated &#8220;tears&#8221; of metal; when it is
held still higher, each drop forms a thin concave cup
or shell, and each of these forms will be found to have
its own peculiar uses in blowpipe work.</p>

<p>The method adopted for granulating tinman&#8217;s
solder, which is very rarely called for, is as follows:
Place a piece of wood, well greased, over a tub containing
water, and by gently pouring the molten alloy
from a distance in a small stream on to the greased
board, the metal is broken up into a large number of
very fine shots, which run off the board into the water<span class="pagenum" id="Page9">[9]</span>
and are immediately cooled. The fine shots are then
taken from the water and gently dried.</p>

<h3>Making Solder from Pewter.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;This alloy is composed
of variable proportions of tin and lead, the
average composition being about 4 parts of lead to
1 part of tin. If old pewter is to be utilised for
making solder, tin will have to be added to the molten
pewter. Thus, to convert 5 lb. of average pewter to
&#8220;coarse&#8221; or &#8220;common&#8221; solder, add 1 lb. of tin; to
&#8220;fine&#8221; or &#8220;medium,&#8221; add 3 lb. of tin; and to &#8220;very
fine&#8221; or &#8220;best,&#8221; add 7 lb. of tin. The respective proportions
of lead and tin will then be 2 and 1; 1 and 1;
and 1 and 2. After the proper quantity of tin has been
added, mix some powdered sal-ammoniac with the
molten metals, and well stir the alloy; it is then ready
for pouring into the moulds.</p>

<h3>Making Coarse Solder from Composition Piping.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;Good
composition piping is made of nearly all tin, or
an alloy of tin and lead, in which the former metal is
in excess, and formerly was much used by plumbers
in the making of coarse solder, as the material consisted
of odd pieces of small value. As, however, a great
deal of composition tubing is made out of old metals
of which lead, tin, antimony, arsenic, and zinc form
the alloy, it is not advisable to introduce it into solder.
Should it be done, the melting point of the solder would
be raised, and in applying it to the lead to be joined
together, would probably partly melt it. Neither do
the metals named alloy in a thorough manner, but
partake more of the nature of a mixture in which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page10">[10]</span>
constituents partly separate when making the joints,
and some, especially zinc, show as small bright lumps
on the surface. Joints wiped with what is usually
called &#8220;poisoned metal&#8221; are difficult to make, almost
invariably leak when on water service pipes, and are
dirty grey, instead of bright and clean. The zinc
could be removed from the mixture by the method
already given.</p>

<h3>Combined Solder and Flux.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;This consisted of
equal parts of lead and tin made into fine tubing and
afterwards filled with flux having resin as a base.
&#8220;Tinol&#8221; is a paste made of finely powdered solder and
a special flux, and there is also &#8220;Tinol wire&#8221; having
a core of flux.</p>

<p>A &#8220;magic&#8221; solder, sold by hawkers, consists of the
above tubular flux-filled solder of such low melting
point that it can be fused in the flame of a lighted
match.</p>

<h3>Soft Solders that Melt in Boiling Water.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;The
following soft solders melt at a temperature lower than
that of boiling water: 1 part tin, 1 part lead, and 2
parts bismuth, melting point about 200&deg; F.; 8 parts
lead, 4 parts tin, 15 parts bismuth, and 3 parts
cadmium, melting point 140&deg; to 150&deg; F.; 6 parts lead,
7 parts bismuth, and 1 part cadmium, melting point
about 180&deg; F. To ensure the alloys melting at the
temperatures stated, the metals of which they are
formed should be free from impurities, and care should
be taken to prevent oxidation while making the alloys.
When melting the metals, that having the highest<span class="pagenum" id="Page11">[11]</span>
melting point should be melted first, with a layer of
resin over it, the other metals being added in the order
of their melting points. The alloy should then be well
stirred with a wooden stick, and poured quickly into
moulds.</p>

<h3>Re-melting and Overheating Solder.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;After solder
has been re-melted a number of times or has been
overheated, its content of tin will be reduced, and the
solder will become poorer and coarser. The tin melts
earlier than the lead and, being the lighter of the two,
floats over it, and is thus fully exposed to the air, the
oxidising effect of which on heated, molten metal is
extremely active. The oxidised tin forms a dross, from
which most of the tin may, however, be recovered by
melting it with powdered charcoal, which combines
with the oxygen and frees the tin. The addition of a
little fresh tin is desirable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page12">[12]</span></p>

<h2><span class="chapno">CHAPTER III</span><br />
<span class="chaptitle">Fluxes Used in Soft-soldering</span></h2>

<h3>Why a Flux is Required.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;The great essential to
successful soldering is the chemical cleanliness of the
surfaces to be united, and the proper use of a flux.
Although work may be filed or scraped perfectly bright
and clean, this is not the kind of cleanliness which is
alone sufficient; there is always in course of formation
a film of oxide present, and the duty of the flux is to
dissolve this and keep any more from forming. Then,
and not until then, will the molten solder &#8220;run&#8221; and
spread over faces in the intimate contact necessary. If
this vital precaution of cleaning and fluxing is always
observed, the difficulties which many beginners experience
in effective soldering will vanish.</p>

<h3>Variety of Fluxes.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;There are a good many fluxes
employed, including tallow (largely used for lead and
pewter), resin (used for lead, compo-pipe, and tinned
metals), hydrochloric acid, diluted (for zinc and
galvanised iron), and chloride of zinc (the well-known
&#8220;killed spirit&#8221;). The last-named is the most generally
used, being suitable for tinplate, tinned iron, new
zinc, copper, and brass. Sal-ammoniac is also utilised,
sometimes in conjunction with chloride of zinc. The
small worker who does but a moderate amount of
soldering will find it convenient to use a soldering<span class="pagenum" id="Page13">[13]</span>
paste such as &#8220;Fluxite,&#8221; which is sold in a tin, and
can be kept handy and applied to the work with a
sliver of wood. &#8220;Tinol&#8221; is a paste flux in combination
with a solder.</p>

<h3>Preparing Zinc Chloride (&#8220;Killed Spirit&#8221;).</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;Make
this flux at home from finely snipped new sheet-zinc
and <i>pure</i> hydrochloric or muriatic acid. (This is sufficiently
cheap at any working druggist&#8217;s stores, and
infinitely preferable to the contaminated oil-shop
quality known as &#8220;spirits of salt.&#8221;) Stand the acid
outdoors in a stoneware crock, add the zinc cuttings
a few at a time at first, and when the first violent
ebullition moderates, put in the rest. Be sure to provide
an excess of metallic zinc, observing that a
quantity remains undissolved after all chemical action
ceases. Leave the metal in the liquor for twelve hours
(covering the crock with a pane of glass), then decant
and filter into a wide-mouth glass jar of handy size.
<i>Do not add water</i> to the concentrated zinc chloride
solution; dilution is sometimes recommended, but
should never be done; the heavy, slightly syrupy,
water-bright liquor should be used as it is. The
alleged &#8220;cleaning&#8221; qualities of this chloride can
scarcely be admitted to exist, and its principal function
is to shield the surfaces of the work from oxidation;
this it fulfils by the formation of a viscid glaze on the
heated metal when the salt reaches its anhydrous
(waterless) condition by evaporation. The addition of
water to the flux, therefore, only uselessly prolongs
the period occupied by evaporation, and wastes heat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page14">[14]</span></p>

<p>Always remove all trace of flux from finished work,
first by soaking in water, and afterwards by washing
with soda, soap, and water. Otherwise, there is the
risk of the work being corroded.</p>

<p>Special &#8220;soldering solutions,&#8221; obtainable ready prepared,
should not be used in preference to zinc chloride
made as before explained or to the well-known paste
fluxes.</p>

<h3>Applying the Flux.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;A short heavy bottle about
3 in. or 4 in. high is best for bench use as a flux container.
It should be particularly noted that soldering
and soldering tackle should be kept as far away from
other work (and iron and steel goods and tools) as
possible.</p>

<p>A pointed wooden stick is not a good tool for
applying killed spirit, because the acid acts on the
wood, which becomes unpleasant to handle, and the
liquid does not leave the wood readily enough to place
the right quantity on the exact spot to be soldered. A
galvanised iron wire is better. Another good tool is a
thin steel or iron &#8220;spit,&#8221; about 12 in. long, and a steel
knitting-needle is also excellent. Should a brush be
preferred, take a few hairs from a broom, place them
in one end of a thin metal tube, and then flatten the
end with a blow from a hammer.</p>

<p>A brush made by hammering the ends of a short
length of cane until the fibres are like bristles is frequently
used for the purpose, the handle end being
soaked in molten wax before using the cane brush the
first time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page15">[15]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig1">
<img src="images/illo015.png" alt="" width="500" height="98" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 1.&mdash;Wire for Applying Flux</p>
</div>

<p>A convenient method of applying liquid flux is to
have a bottle with a screw cap sprinkling top such as
is often used for perfumes, and to push a length of
thick galvanised iron wire through the orifice in the
stopper, leaving about 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. projecting above. The
lower end should just reach the bottom of the bottle,
and may be flattened and pointed. The lead nipple is
squeezed round the wire to hold it firmly, and the projecting
end bent into a ring to form a handle, as shown
in <a href="#Fig1">Fig. 1</a>. The cork part should be thinned a little to
render it an easy fit in the bottle neck. The flux can
be quickly applied with the wire exactly where it is
wanted, and in very small quantity; for a long seam
the wire can be run along with one dip in the solution.
The fingers need not be brought into contact with the
flux; the cork will not go soft and will not sink down
owing to the lead flange supporting it.</p>

<h3>Flux Used on Food Containers.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;Killed spirits is
objectionable as a flux for soldering vessels intended to
contain food of any kind. Not only is this flux a
poison, but it is liable to produce subsequent rusting
wherever used unless all traces of it are thoroughly
removed immediately after soldering. A good non-poisonous
flux suitable for tin boxes may be made by
dissolving resin in oil. Place a quantity of powdered
resin in an iron vessel, add colza, olive, or any similar<span class="pagenum" id="Page16">[16]</span>
oil, and apply gentle heat, meanwhile stirring it until
the resin is dissolved. Dissolve as much resin in the
oil as possible without making the flux too thick (when
cold) to apply with a brush. One or two small experiments
will soon decide the required proportions. The
resin is really the base of the flux; but the oil is added
to facilitate its application and removal before and after
the soldering process.</p>

<h2><span class="chapno">CHAPTER IV</span><br />
<span class="chaptitle">Soft-soldering with the Copper Bit</span></h2>

<p><b>Choice between Blowpipe and Bit.</b>&mdash;The method
of heating depends on the size of the work, or rather
the area to be soldered, and the conveniences at the
command of the worker. The soldering bit, although
so commonly used, is not necessarily the best for
the beginner to use for small work. A blowpipe flame&mdash;from
a bunsen burner or a spirit lamp&mdash;is far more
convenient and neat, and its effects can be applied and
localised with the greatest precision, down to the
merest pin point of heat applied at a definite spot.
The bit is chiefly useful for long joints such as in tinplate
work, and for pieces bound together to which the
bit is applied to heat up and melt solder between them.
But for work where the soldering area does not measure
more than an inch or so (and there is a vast amount
of this kind), the blowpipe flame is far preferable. It
must be admitted, though, that this is a matter in
which some workmen might have two distinct
opinions; and, as already remarked, the bit is far more
commonly used.</p>

<h3>Copper Bits.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;The soldering bit or bolt (miscalled

(see <a href="#Fig3">Fig. 3</a>) to enable them to point at various angles

<p>A home-made bit (<a href="#Fig4">Figs. 4</a> and <a href="#Fig5">5</a>) may be made by
drilling and tapping a short length of 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>-in. or 2-in.
square copper to receive the screwed end of a rod of
<sup>5</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub>-in. iron, the copper being afterwards heated and
drawn to a point or to a blunt edge as preferred. This
forms a good bit for most ordinary purposes. An
axe-head or hatchet bit is shown in <a href="#Fig6">Fig. 6</a>; the copper
bolt is riveted in the eye of the iron rod, the bit, however,
being free to revolve, as this is essential when
making joints in heavy lead pipe, for which purpose it
is principally used. <a href="#Fig5">Fig. 5</a> represents a bit which is a
combination and modification of the two others, and
it is largely used for the internal soldering of bottoms
of large drums, milk churns, etc., where great local

<p>As to the size of bit required, for ordinary small<span class="pagenum" id="Page19">[19]</span>
work the straight type should not be less than 8 oz. or
10 oz. (weight of the actual copper).</p>

<p>Two bits are very useful in doing a large job,
as the work can then be arranged to progress
continuously, one bit heating while the other is
in use.</p>

<p>A bit suitable for quite light work can be easily
made by drilling and tapping a piece of copper, say
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. by <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in.
by 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. long, either in the end or in the
side, for a <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub>-in. steel rod 12 in. long, a handle being
then fitted at the other end.</p>

<p>In the &#8220;Tinol&#8221; telescopic soldering bit for
amateurs&#8217; use, the handle is in three parts: (<i>a</i>) the
actual wooden handle bushed with metal, and provided
with a set-screw shaped like a screw eye, and therefore
easily turned; (<i>b</i>) a steel tube which telescopes into
the first part, and which is also provided with a set-screw;
and (<i>c</i>) a short rod, having at one end a<span class="pagenum" id="Page20">[20]</span>
hatchet-shaped copper bit. The extreme length of the
tool is 12 in., and the length, when the parts are
telescoped together, is about 5 in.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Fluxite&#8221; bit is larger and heavier. It has a
hollow cast-iron handle, perforated to dissipate the
heat, threaded internally at one end to receive the
screwed end of the iron stem, only 5 in. or so in
length, which at the other end screws into an adapter
or holder which, in turn, receives the screwed end of
the copper bolt, itself about 4 in. long. The bit is
taken to pieces in a few moments, and is quite a workmanlike
tool.</p>

<h3>Spirit-Heated Soldering Bits.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;Bits heated by
benzoline or spirit may be made with a small barrel-shaped
reservoir which also forms the handle. One
end of the reservoir is fitted with a filling cap, and
from the opposite end protrudes the tube carrying the
burner. To the tube end of the reservoir an iron clip
is attached, and this secures an iron bar which stands
out over the burner head. At the end of this bar the
copper bit is attached and held either vertically or<span class="pagenum" id="Page21">[21]</span>
horizontally in the flame. Tool merchants&#8217; catalogues
show a variety of such implements. <a href="#Fig7">Fig. 7</a> illustrates
one of the most elaborate of them all, the weight complete
being 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> lb. It has a polished brass container <span class="smcapall">A</span>,
of <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>5</sub> pint capacity&mdash;sufficient for 45 to 60 minutes,
whence the benzoline flows to the burner <span class="smcapall">B</span>, the flame
from which heats the copper bit <span class="smcapall">C</span>. This bit may be
of any of the regular shapes, and weighs about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> lb.
The position shown is that for heating the bit preparatory
to soldering. The tray <span class="smcapall">D</span> catches any drips
that might occur at starting, <span class="smcapall">E</span> is the stand, <span class="smcapall">F</span> the filler
cap, <span class="smcapall">G</span> is the regulating handle, and <span class="smcapall">H</span> is the clamp that
holds the bit in place.</p>

<p>A writer in <i>Popular Mechanics</i> has stated that
the ordinary blow-lamp, with the burner end equipped
with a copper bolt (see <a href="#Fig8">Fig. 8</a>), makes an excellent
soldering device. The point can be easily kept at the
proper heat, and there will be no want for hot coppers.
The end of the burner is threaded on the outside, and
a hole is drilled in the copper point and threaded to
match. Small holes are drilled in the copper in the
same manner as in the burner, to make vents for the
flame.</p>

<h3>Gas-heated Bits.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;These are largely used in factories,
and are cleanly, expeditious, safe, and convenient.
The type shown by <a href="#Fig9">Fig. 9</a> is very handy, and the
illustration and description are due to F. X. Sommers,
Jun., in the <i>American Machinist</i>. A mixture of air
and gas enters the pipe at about 10 lb. pressure, or
enough to give a hot, blue flame. The part <span class="smcapall">A</span> is of
cast-iron, which, on experiment, has been found to
last longer without corroding than steel, although
copper would be better. The soldering bolt <span class="smcapall">B</span> was
made of steel because it kept the correct shape point
much longer than cast-iron or copper, although the
latter metal is better for transmitting the heat.
The point should be tinned before using. This
form of soldering head is being used on automatic can-soldering
machines, and does the work effectively. It
also saves gas. It will heat to the correct temperature
in about 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> minutes.</p>

<p>A gas-heated bit invented by W. G. Ryan is shown
in <a href="#Fig10">Figs. 10</a> to <a href="#Fig13">13</a>. The actual bit <span class="smcapall">A</span> is held in a steel
sheath <span class="smcapall">B</span> having a space underneath the bit to allow
the gas to pass. The sheath has a row of holes on
each side to allow the gas to come through, the flame
enveloping the bit when in use. The gas, supplied
through a flexible tube, passes through the tube that
forms the handle, at the end of which is a small
chamber <span class="smcapall">C</span> to admit air, which mixes with the gas to
cause it to burn atmospherically, the supply of gas
passing through a small cone valve <span class="smcapall">D</span> and thence
through the air chamber. In the air-inlet holes <span class="smcapall">E</span> at<span class="pagenum" id="Page23">[23]</span>
the end of the air chamber are fitted small cones <span class="smcapall">F</span> to
regulate the quantity of air. All the cones, including
the gas-valve cone, are connected rigidly together, so
that when cutting down the gas supply temporarily,
the air supply is automatically reduced, and the gas
flame remains in being, although its size is much
reduced. It has been found that, in some gas-heated
bits, the cutting down of the gas seriously interferes
with the proportion of the gas and air mixture, resulting<span class="pagenum" id="Page24">[24]</span>
in a back-fire. The device here described has been
invented especially to obviate that trouble. To reduce
the gas supply and, with it, the air supply also, all that
is necessary is a slight forward movement of the fitting
to which the cones or needles are attached. The
copper bit is kept in position by the sheath or clip, the
small bolt in which can be taken out in a moment when
special attention to the bit becomes necessary. The
connection to the flexible gas tubing is at <span class="smcapall">G</span>, while <span class="smcapall">H</span>
indicates a guide and stuffing box for the gas-valve cone
or needle.</p>

<h3>Stoves for Heating Soldering Bits.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;Although a
copper bit may be heated in any fire, it is better to
avoid the dirt, smoke and tarry stickiness which are
often present in a coal fire. In the absence of gas,
a bright, clear coke fire or a charcoal fire should be
used whenever available. Portable oil stoves of the
wickless type can also be employed, but the ideal fuel
is gas, which may be regulated at will to give a<span class="pagenum" id="Page25">[25]</span>
uniform temperature. Two gas-stoves specially constructed
for copper bits are shown by <a href="#Fig14">Figs. 14</a> and <a href="#Fig15">15</a>.</p>

</div>

<h3>Tinning a Bit.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;Before a bit can be used, it must
be &#8220;tinned,&#8221; that is, coated with solder in a smooth
complete covering, for which purpose&mdash;by one method,
not the best, but the most general&mdash;the end is heated
to a dull red, rubbed quickly with the file on the facets,
dipped in killed spirit or &#8220;fluxite,&#8221; or rubbed against
a piece of sal-ammoniac, and then applied to a stick or
lump of solder, the facets being quickly wiped or
rubbed on a piece of tinplate so as to spread the solder
evenly. When properly done, the nose of the bit is
coated with a smooth film of solder. This must
always remain so, or the bit will not act, and when it
is honeycombed, or the &#8220;tinning&#8221; is present in
patches, it must be re-tinned. A bit must never be
raised to a red heat sufficient to melt the tinning. The
bit does not operate well at such a heat, because its
contact makes solder too fluid and apt to run too
quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page26">[26]</span></p>

<p>When dipping a hot bit, prepared for tinning, into
killed spirit, a sharp pop, without smoke or spluttering,
denotes the right temperature. If, on withdrawing
the bit, it is damp and still unclean, it had
not been heated sufficiently.</p>

<p>Another method of tinning may be mentioned.
Into a small and clean tin box (a 2-oz. tobacco tin
about <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in. deep) put some scraps of solder and
powdered resin. Heat the bit to a very dull red,
quickly file up clean on one side of the point, and then
plunge into the solder and resin and rub about; it will
at once take on a coat of the alloy. A second side of
the bit may be tinned by then repeating the operation,
re-heating if necessary. The bottom of the box
should be covered with solder, which adheres easily
enough, with a film of resin on top. It is probably
most convenient to tin the under side and the left-hand
working face of the bit. &#8220;Tinol&#8221; could be used
in this way without admixture with anything.</p>

<p>Still another method is to use a firebrick having a
hollow in which the solder and resin are placed; but
the tin box plan is thought to be better.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the best method of tinning a bit is
that in use by the plumber who well knows the
invaluable qualities of sal-ammoniac (ammonium
chloride) for the purpose. He has no wish to squander
energy on those vigorous rubbings of the bit&mdash;on
paving-stone, bath brick, tinplate, etc. etc., and he
believes that the habit of dipping the bit into zinc
chloride is both slovenly and wasteful, for not only is<span class="pagenum" id="Page27">[27]</span>
this corrosive stuff sprayed about broadcast, but the
remainder is soon rendered unfit for its purpose by contamination
with copper chloride and dirt from the fire.
The outlay of a few halfpence on a sizable slab of sal-ammoniac
will keep the bit in the best condition for
years, and save hours of superfluous labour. Commercial
sal-ammoniac is obtainable in large, rugged
crystals of a tough, fibrous texture. A piece weighing
upwards of <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> lb. can be trimmed to a roughly rectangular
slab, a few inches long and wide and about
1 in. thick; and a cavity should be scooped in one of the
flat sides to accommodate the bit.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig16">
<img src="images/illo027.png" alt="" width="500" height="270" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 16.&mdash;Tinning Bit in Sal-ammoniac Block</p>
</div>

<p>Let the bit-faces be made shapely and filed bright
and the tool thoroughly heated in a clean fire,
removed, flicked free of ash, and then held down firmly
in the cavity of the sal-ammoniac block (see <a href="#Fig16">Fig. 16</a>).
Profuse white fumes will arise, and the surface of the
salt will fuse. Bear heavily on each facet in turn, and
then melt a few beads of solder into the cavity along
with the bit, and the latter will become brightly tinned<span class="pagenum" id="Page28">[28]</span>
in a moment or so. The bit should be applied to the
&#8220;ammonia block&#8221; every few heats, or as required, as
the work progresses, and flicked with a tuft of
dampened cotton-waste.</p>

<p>The sal-ammoniac has one great disadvantage&mdash;it
is deliquescent (collecting moisture from a damp
atmosphere), and its near proximity to most metals
oxidises and corrodes them. Iron and steel, particularly,
it rusts rapidly and deeply. Therefore the tools
(saw and chisel) used to shape the block must be
washed, dried, warmed, and greased before they are
laid by, and the waste fragments must be carefully
swept up and disposed of. The block itself must
always be kept apart from tools. Plumbers enclose it
in a sheet-lead box wrapped in a greasy rag; amateurs
may store it on a dry shelf, parcelled in waxed paper
secured by a rubber band, or in a length of motor-tyre
inner tube, rolled up.</p>

<h3>Simple Soldering.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;Scrupulous cleanliness in everything
connected with the process of soldering is
essential to success. The ordinary procedure in
making a joint is to clean the surfaces first by filing
or scraping with a scraper or a knife or a plumber&#8217;s
shave-hook (<a href="#Fig17">Fig. 17</a>). In some cases, dirty metal is
cleansed with dilute hydrochloric acid. With or without
preliminary heating of the work, flux is then
applied to the joint, and the heated bit is held in one
hand and a stick of solder in the other, and the stick
drawn along the joint while the bit touches it (or
&#8220;drops&#8221; of solder may be transferred to the work by<span class="pagenum" id="Page29">[29]</span>
means of the bit). This will cause a line of molten
solder to run, and some skill and care are necessary to
get just the right amount of solder without wasting it
and allowing it to spread in a lumpy fashion beyond
the necessary area. The bit is next worked up and
down the joint to spread the solder, and by the transmitted
heat to make it thoroughly penetrate the joint.
This is an outline of the process, and there is a number
of points requiring special instruction or a few words
of caution.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig17">
<img src="images/illo029.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="155" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 17.&mdash;Shave-hook</p>
</div>

<p>Note that the work must be filed, scraped, or otherwise
mechanically cleaned, and then chemically cleaned
by coating with the flux just where the soldering is
required. In heating the copper bit do not let it reach
even a dull red heat. Lightly dip it into the flux to
clean the point; then, with a small button or blob of
solder resting on the work, place the bit momentarily
upon it to cause the solder to flow, and draw the bit
where the solder is required.</p>

<p>Many beginners try to draw along the solder with
an insufficiently heated bit. The result is a series of
lumps&mdash;&#8220;putting it on with a trowel,&#8221; as it is sometimes
termed. A good joint cannot be made this way,
however much solder may be used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page30">[30]</span></p>

<p>Some beginners fly to the other extreme, and try
to make a neat job with a red-hot bit, which results in
the solder assuming a sandy appearance and in the
work being discoloured.</p>

<p>Others try to solder uphill&mdash;that is, they hold or
place the work in such a way as to cause the solder to
flow away from where it is required. The correct
method is to solder downhill by tilting or inclining the
work, so that the solder will always collect around and
travel with the point of the bit. This, besides facilitating
the work, makes a strong joint, and imparts a
clean and neat appearance to the job.</p>

<p class="caption">Figs. 18 and 19.&mdash;Incorrect and Correct Methods of Holding Bit</p>

</div><!--twofigs5050-->

<p class="allclear">A common mistake is to hold the bit in a cramped
and awkward way, as in <a href="#Fig18">Fig. 18</a>, the hand being
twisted under the handle, the thumb being brought to
the top, and the elbow forced to the side. The correct
positions of arm and fingers are shown in <a href="#Fig19">Fig. 19</a>; the
elbow is held well out from the body, and the thumb
is placed directly under the handle of the bit, forming
a fulcrum over which the bit may be slightly raised or
depressed at will. This is all-important when soldering
very fusible metals such as pewter, tin, etc., on
which the weight of the copper bit should never be
allowed to rest, as otherwise a hole will suddenly be
made in the work. The whole weight of the bit should
be supported and balanced on the thumb by the downward
pressure of that part of the hand close to the little
finger. The worker should not for a moment lose
control of the copper bit, and control is always assured
when the thumb is underneath the handle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page31">[31]</span></p>

<p>There is but little strength in a butt joint with the
edges of the metal only just touching&mdash;that is, without
a lap; to take the example of a small cylinder, the body
seam should have at least a <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>-in. lap. <a href="#Fig20">Fig. 20</a> represents
an example of internal grooved seam soldering,
which may be executed in the following way:&mdash;After
applying the flux, place a small button of solder inside
the cylinder on the seam, rest the bit momentarily
on the solder to melt it, and then draw it gently along
the seam. The cylinder should be slightly tilted to
allow of the solder travelling with the point of the bit.
The hand should avoid touching any part of the work
that comes directly into contact with the copper bit, as
otherwise the hand would be badly burned.</p>

</div><!--twofigs5050-->

<p>The method of internally soldering the bottom on a
canister, etc., is shown in <a href="#Fig21">Fig. 21</a>. The bottom is<span class="pagenum" id="Page32">[32]</span>
held in position by gently pressing it against (but not
placing it on) the bench during the soldering process,
while the tilt of the canister and the position of the bit
cause the solder to travel with the bit.</p>

<p>In soldering all such articles, the soldering should
be done with one sweep of the bit, the left hand meanwhile
making the necessary revolution. This saves
time and solder, and avoids the unsightly appearance
of a series of starts and stops.</p>

<p id="Ref03">In work of a larger and more substantial nature,
as, for example, galvanised or tinned iron work, the
bottom of the article is first &#8220;knocked up,&#8221; and then
soldered internally. <a href="#Fig21">Fig. 21</a> represents an example
of internal soldering where the whole weight of the bit
is shown resting on the molten solder inside; this provides
the local heat required to &#8220;sweat&#8221; the solder into<span class="pagenum" id="Page33">[33]</span>
the four thicknesses of metal which constitute the
bottom seam; and for this work the bottoming bit
shown in <a href="#Fig3">Fig. 3</a> is often used. Pewter, lead, zinc and
tin&mdash;the latter should not be confused with tinplate&mdash;do
not require sweating, on account of their
low fusibility, and any attempt even to solder them
with a very hot bit will probably end disastrously.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig22">
<img src="images/illo033.jpg" alt="" width="286" height="350" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 22.&mdash;Soldering Can Externally</p>
</div>

<p><a href="#Fig22">Fig. 22</a> shows an
example of external
seam soldering. The
method there shown is
invariably adopted for
simple lap seams, although
grooved seams
are similarly soldered.
A grooved seam, however,
should preferably be
soldered internally. The
position of the worker&#8217;s
elbow and thumb should
be noted, as should also
the tilt of the cylinder (more pronounced in this case
than the other) in order to secure the downflow of
the solder.</p>

<p>Sweating has already been mentioned. It should
be said that one of the easiest ways in which a
beginner may make a reliable joint is to prepare both
faces of the joint by fluxing and covering with a thin
film of solder, and then pressing the two parts together
with the hot bit until the top part &#8220;floats&#8221; and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page34">[34]</span>
settles down. The advantage of this way is that one
can be sure of perfect application of the solder to the
joint faces, since each is dealt with first and thoroughly
coated, with no faulty patches. Sweating is also done
in the flame of a bunsen burner or blowpipe, as explained
later.</p>

<h3>Reinforced and Filled-in Soldered Joints.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;The
bottoms of square or cylindrical vessels should, preferably,
be soldered from the inside, and &#8220;buttons&#8221; of
solder may be melted to assume a stout triangular-shape
stud in the corners of the square vessels. A
tinned rivet is sometimes riveted or just placed in a
corner, and sufficient solder floated over it to strengthen
the corner. Solder is always liable to run through an
improperly closed seam at the corner when external
soldering is resorted to; but in cases where this is the
only practical method, a tinned rivet may be inserted
from the outside, and then soldered over. It sometimes
happens that two &#8220;raw&#8221; edges require soldering
together without a lap. Where a strong joint is
required a good plan is to place a length of tinned wire
over both edges and solder the lot together. In
addition to strengthening the joint, the wire considerably
improves the general appearance. A simpler
joint may be made by &#8220;skimming&#8221; the solder over
with a copper bit heated only just sufficiently to melt
the solder. The quick and skilful touch is required
to perform this operation satisfactorily; but a little
practice will soon bring the necessary proficiency.
The idea is to &#8220;draw&#8221; the solder across the joint<span class="pagenum" id="Page35">[35]</span>
quickly, before it has time to run through. This
method is useful when soldering thin metal goods of a
lower degree of fusibility than that of the solder
employed. No preparation for filling cracks previous
to soldering can be recommended, beyond such small
pieces of metal that may be afterwards soldered over
and effectively hidden. It is much better to endeavour
to produce work of such quality that this expedient is
altogether unnecessary.</p>

<h3>Soldering Heavy Milk Churns.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;When soldering
the bottom rims on large milk churns, sufficient heat
cannot be maintained with only one soldering bit. At
least two heavy bits are required, so that one may be
getting hot while the other is in use. The rims are
usually tinned before being fixed by first pickling them
in dilute hydrochloric acid, washing, and then dipping
in a bath of molten tin. When repairing and resoldering
the rims, remove all dirt and rust with a file,
use a few brushfuls of raw spirits further to assist the
cleaning process, then wash with clean water and
solder in the usual way, using killed spirits as a flux.</p>

or file away the enamel quite clear all round the hole,
apply a little raw spirit to the surface of the iron, and
coat it with solder in the usual manner. Then cut out
a tin disc large enough to cover the hole, and solder
this in, using killed spirit as the flux.</p>

<h3>Soldering Leaded Lights.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;For soldering the calmes
of a lead-light window, the calmes having been fitted
properly together, shave a small round dot at the point<span class="pagenum" id="Page36">[36]</span>
of junction, sprinkle a little powdered resin on the
shaving, and with a copper bit or with a glazier&#8217;s iron
having a tinned face, melt a small piece of tinman&#8217;s
ordinary solder on the shaved part so that it tins to the
lead and forms a round button.</p>

<h3>Soldering Catch on Gun-barrel.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;In soldering a
catch on a gun barrel it will first be necessary to tin
both barrel and catch, and then to wire them together,
in addition binding the barrels for some distance from
each side of the catch, making the ribs secure with
wedges. To melt the solder, use heaters; these are
generally made of copper with iron handles; or iron
rods can be used, the ends being made red hot and
inserted in the barrels. Cut some small slips of thin
solder and place them on each side of the catch, using
powdered resin. As soon as the solder melts, remove
the heaters and cool the barrels.</p>

<h3>The Mouth Blowpipe.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;Although soft-soldering is
usually associated with the use of a copper bit, quite
a number of jobs can be done without one, using
instead a bunsen burner or, more generally, a mouth
blowpipe, which is an inexpensive appliance, useful for
both hard and soft soldering, and with either gas,<span class="pagenum" id="Page38">[38]</span>
candle, or a methylated-spirit flame. Three shapes
of mouth blowpipe are shown in <a href="#Fig23">Figs. 23</a> to <a href="#Fig25">25</a>. In a
blowpipe flame there are three cones, X, Y, Z (<a href="#Fig26">Fig.
26</a>). X is a non-luminous cone, consisting of a
mixture of atmospheric air and unburnt combustible
gases (each with a low temperature); Y is a luminous
cone, composed of burning gases (carbon and carbonic
acid being in excess); and Z is a cone the oxygen in
which renders it less luminous and free from combustible
materials, its temperature being exceptionally
high, especially where the cone comes in contact with
the point of the cone Y. Because of its properties, Z
is termed the oxidising or outer flame, whilst Y is
known as the inner or reducing flame, because when it
is applied to some easily reducible substance&mdash;say, lead
oxide&mdash;the oxygen in the substance heated mingles
with the unburnt carbon in the cone of the flame and
produces carbonic oxide, the lead being thus separated
or reduced. The blowpipe flame is one of intense
heat, even that produced by blowing a common candle
being capable of melting metallic fragments when they<span class="pagenum" id="Page39">[39]</span>
are supported on a bed of charcoal. The pointed flame
gives the greatest heat, and this can be produced
simply by increasing or decreasing the space between
the flame and the article to be soldered or the metal
to be melted.</p>

<p>The particular advantage of a blowpipe is that it
gives a fierce heat at a very localised area, beyond
which the solder does not run, and it enables spots to
be soldered, or parts to be unsoldered, adjusted and
re-soldered without allowing heat to stray and cause
trouble at other places. A useful little addition to the
ordinary blowpipe is a small washer soldered on near
the mouth end (see <a href="#Fig23">Fig. 23</a>), the object of this being
to raise this part off the bench and so keep it from contamination
with dirt, filings, etc., which are unpleasant
to the lips. Sometimes the washer is made elliptical
and slightly concave to fit the lips, so that it forms a<span class="pagenum" id="Page40">[40]</span>
convenient stop or steady when the blowpipe is held
between the teeth without help from either hand.</p>

<h3>Bunsen Burner, Spirit Lamps, etc.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;The bunsen
burner is, of course, the most convenient device for
heating (when the bit is not in question); but failing
a gas supply, a spirit-lamp must be employed. This
is a small glass bottle with wick, methylated spirit
being used. Plumbers and gasfitters make use of metal
tubular lamps fed with spirit poured on cotton-wool,
and having a blowpipe tube attached and coupled up
to the lips with a rubber tube; they also use wax tapers.</p>

<p class="allclear">A methylated wick lamp may be easily made out of
a small &#8220;self-opening&#8221; canister, as shown in <a href="#Fig27">Fig. 27</a>.
The holes near the top increase the efficiency of the
flame. Another spirit soldering-lamp is shown by
<a href="#Fig28">Fig. 28</a>. The container for the spirit can be made
about 3 in. in diameter by about 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. deep, with a

explain the burner. An outer wick surrounds a piece
of tube, which itself contains another wick. The
spirit in the inner tube is vaporised by the heat from
the burner when the outside wick is lit. The spirit
vapour issues from a <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>32</sub>-in. hole at
<span class="smcapall">A</span>. At <span class="smcapall">B</span> a ring
is slipped over the outer wick, holding it to the central

the gas is connected by an iron or compo pipe under
the bench. A second gas tap should be arranged in
the supply to regulate
the amount of gas,
and for reasons of
safety. A simple device
(see <a href="#Fig30">Fig. 30</a>) may
be made by anyone,
and connected to a

head on the gas
bracket supplying
light to the bench

</div>

<p>A design of gas
blowpipe which
leaves one hand free is shown by <a href="#Fig31">Fig. 31</a>. This
enables the worker to apply the solder to the work
(holding the end of a strip against it), after it has
been brought to the melting heat of the solder. The
blowpipe is arranged so that it can be held in the hand
or dropped into a hole in the bench.</p>

<h3>Tapers.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;Tapers for a blowpipe flame are made by
untwisting cotton rope until the threads of the individual
strands are straight. These are then dipped<span class="pagenum" id="Page42">[42]</span>
in melted wax made by melting two wax candles over
a gas stove in a jam jar. They are repeatedly dipped
until sufficient thickness of wax is obtained. The wax
should be just sufficiently hot to keep melted.</p>

<h3>Catching-tray for
Bunsen Burner.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;The
blowpipe is not
essential for some
kinds of work, such
as when the job can
be held wholly in
the flame without
causing any damage.
When solder is being
melted to drop on to
a surface, the plain
bunsen or atmospheric
flame is also
sufficient, though in
this case it is well to
tilt the burner over
so as to prevent the
solder dropping
down the tube. An
elbow fitted on the top of the tube is handy in this
connection, to deflect the flame at an angle, and <a href="#Fig32">Figs.
32</a> and <a href="#Fig33">33</a> show this, with the addition of a tray to
catch the dripping solder which otherwise would
splash on the bench and cause untidiness. The tray
is riveted to a strip of brass bent round to slip over
the outside of the elbow, and a small pin riveted into
the tube prevents the tray from falling down.</p>

<h3>Blow Lamps.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;A soldering lamp is used sometimes
in the place of a blowpipe, and it should combine perfect
security with compactness and portability. Tool
merchants&#8217; catalogues show a number of styles. In
the lamp shown by <a href="#Fig34">Fig. 34</a>, benzoline is burnt. When
the lamp is in use and the body of it is very hot, the
inside pressure does not exceed three-fifths of an
atmosphere, whether the regulator <span class="smcapall">R</span> is open or almost
closed. Thus the danger of explosion, which is such
a drawback to some of the lamps that use ordinary
paraffin, is avoided. The upper parts of the lamp are
subjected to great heat and therefore are packed with
asbestos, which serves as a filter and stops any impurity
in the benzoline from getting to the burner.
The flame can be lowered to a glimmer when not
actually in use, thus saving the trouble of relighting.
When the lamp is to be used, the regulator <span class="smcapall">R</span> is screwed
up tight; and care must be taken to ascertain, from
time to time, that the burner or nipple <span class="smcapall">C</span> is open and
perfectly clean. If this becomes obstructed, it can be
cleaned by unscrewing the tube <span class="smcapall">T</span> and passing a fine
steel wire through the hole. The lamp should be completely
filled with benzoline every time it is to be used.
A little methylated spirits is poured into the basin <span class="smcapall">A</span>,
and set alight. When the apparatus has become
slightly warm, the regulator is opened gradually. To
extinguish the flame, the regulator must be screwed up
tight. If any escape is observed round the screw of
the regulator, the square <span class="smcapall">P</span> should be screwed up with
the key supplied by the makers, so as to tighten the
asbestos packing. The lamp above described is only
one of a great number of such appliances, but it is fairly
typical of them all. The difference between a
solderer&#8217;s and a brazer&#8217;s blowlamp is merely one of
size and power.</p>

<h3>How to Operate a Mouth Blowpipe.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;The operation
of using the mouth blowpipe does not consist in
blowing intermittent and strong blasts with the lungs,
as this would soon exhaust the wind power. For very
light jobs, however, this method is sometimes adopted;
but once the proper way is discovered, the user
naturally falls into the use of this method.</p>

<p>The proper way to keep a continuous blast is to
breathe naturally through the nose, and at the same
time keep the cheeks distended by forcing the air at
sufficient pressure from the lungs. The cheeks
naturally resist the pressure, and force the air through
the blowpipe. The operation requires some practice
and a clear nose passage. There is practically no
limit to the time a continuous blast can be kept up.</p>

<p>The blowpipe flame is produced by holding the
blast end of the blowpipe just above the wick of the
taper and touching the flame; the blast then causes a
long blue flame to project. This flame is hottest at
the tip, which is slightly brown.</p>

<h3>Typical Blowpipe Jobs.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;Some of the photographic
reproductions in this chapter show the methods of
soldering comparatively light and heavy articles. <span class="pagenum" id="Page47">[47]</span>
<a href="#Fig35">Fig. 35</a> shows a lading-can handle being resoldered. As it
had broken away, the old solder remained, and the
joint did not need cleaning. It is dabbed with the
killed-spirit brush, and a small piece of solder put near
the joint. The flame is first played on the parts away
from the solder to get them to the requisite heat, and
as the heat reaches the solder it melts, and flows where<span class="pagenum" id="Page48">[48]</span>
required. Where the solder should be the thickest,
that part of the joint is inclined downwards.</p>

<p>A job needing very much heat, and therefore a continuous
blast for some time, is shown by <a href="#Fig36">Fig. 36</a>. A
lug is shown being soldered to a heavy brass lamp
bottom. Before putting the lug in position the parts
of the joints have to be tinned. This consists of applying
a film of solder. In this case the heat is applied
to the lamp bottom for several minutes, and without
loss of time the part where the lug fits is cleaned with
a fine file, the spirit brush dabbed on a piece of solder,
put in position, and the flame again applied. The
solder almost immediately flows over the cleaned
portion; if it does not flow as required, the flame is
played on the solder and lamp bottom, a dab with the
spirit brush helping matters. The lug, which should
have been previously tinned, is placed in position on
the lamp bottom, and with a slight application of the
flame, the solder flows and unites the parts firmly
together. It should be particularly noted that, when
uniting light articles to heavy ones, the light ones
should be tinned first, and secured to the heavier
article whilst the latter is still hot.</p>

one end, and a small hole made in the centre of the
depression. The bead of solder is placed in this
depression, and held over the joint to be soldered; the
flame is then played on the joint and on the solder
which flows through the hole.</p>

<h3>Re-soldering Kettle Spout.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;Refixing a spout in a
&#8220;tinned&#8221; wrought-iron or copper kettle. The spout and
that part of the kettle which comes in contact with it
should first of all be filed bright and clean. Next place
the spout in position, apply killed spirits, and hold it
over a bunsen flame, as in <a href="#Fig41">Fig. 41</a>, until sufficient
of the strip solder is melted to flow around and sweat
through to make a strong sound joint. Should any
difficulty be experienced in getting the solder to flow
readily, apply a little more flux.</p>

<h3>Soldering Corroded Metal.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;When the surface of
metal to be soldered is badly corroded, and it is
difficult to obtain a clean, bright surface preparatory to
soldering, it should be treated to a liberal application
of raw spirits of salts (hydrochloric acid), which will
soon remove the cause of the trouble, but all traces of
the acid should be washed away with clean water before
attempting the soldering. It is also a good plan in
these cases to tin the surface by repeatedly rubbing it
with a hot bit and solder, together with plenty of killed<span class="pagenum" id="Page51">[51]</span>
spirits, before proceeding with the actual soldering
process.</p>

<h3>Soldering Small Work.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;When soldering two
small awkward-shaped pieces together, they can be
held in position by pressing slightly into a piece of
damp clay. When the work has several soldered
joints it can be buried in sand or covered with clay to
confine the heat to the part being operated on.</p>

<p>Although care should be taken to limit the solder
to the area of the joint, there are circumstances in
many cases where it is difficult to prevent some of it
from straying. To clean this off, resort may be had<span class="pagenum" id="Page52">[52]</span>
to the blowpipe, applying the blast and quickly wiping
the surface while the solder is in a molten state. Or
it may be filed off while cold and finished with a
scraper or a knife and emery-cloth. Or if there is only
a thin film the knife or emery-cloth alone will suffice.</p>

<h3>Soldering Pipe Joints.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;Most joints in lead, tin
and compo. pipe are now preferably made by means of
a blowlamp, or with a mouth blowpipe, strip-solder
being used. When making the joint, heat the pipe in
the immediate vicinity, and, dipping the solder in the
flux, stroke it around the pipe to form the joint.</p>

<p>In soldering block tin or compo. pipe with a bit, if
this is too hot it will promptly melt the pipe. This is
also liable to happen with very thin zinc. The only
way to prevent this is to have the bit just hot enough
to melt the solder, and not to let it rest any length of
time on the soft metal.</p>

<p class="allclear">In making connections with soft pipe it is better
to make use of brass couplings, and these can be
soldered more easily and safely by means of the blowpipe
than with a bit. First clean and tin both ends
of the coupling, and with the bit put a little ring of
solder round about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> in. from the end, as shown at <span class="smcapall">D</span>
in <a href="#Fig42">Fig. 42</a>. Next with a penknife cut a hole in the
pipe <span class="smcapall">B</span> where the connection is wanted, a neat fit for
the end of the coupling tail <span class="smcapall">A</span>, scraping the surface of
the pipe all round the hole. Insert the coupling in
the hole in a vertical position. Sprinkle a little
powdered resin round the joint, or smear it with fluxite.
Using the flame of a spirit lamp or a candle and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page53">[53]</span>
mouth blowpipe, heat the upper part of the coupling,
being careful not to allow the flame to come too near
the soft pipe. The solder will soon melt, and run
down into the joint (see <span class="smcapall">D</span> in <a href="#Fig43">Fig. 43</a>), when the flame
must be instantly withdrawn. The same proceeding
can be adopted in soldering the other portion of the
coupling into the connecting pipe. If a vertical
position is inconvenient for the coupling it can still be
soldered in that position, and afterwards twisted carefully
into the desired position. In <a href="#Fig42">Figs. 42</a> and <a href="#Fig43">43</a>, <span class="smcapall">C</span>

<h3>Soldering Birdcage Wires.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;For this job, it is
better to flatten out the solder to the thinness of brown
paper and with a pair of scissors or shears to cut it
into very narrow strips. Take little pieces about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in.
long, and with the fingers pinch them round the wires
just above the joints to be soldered. Touch each joint
with a small quantity of killed spirit, and apply the
flame of a small blowlamp just underneath the joint;<span class="pagenum" id="Page54">[54]</span>
this will cause the solder to run in the joint in an
instant (see <a href="#Fig44">Fig. 44</a>). The flame is quite free from
smoke, and does not discolour the wire in the least, as
the solder will run long before the wire is red hot.
Every joint may thus be neatly made. With a thin
piece of copper wire secured in a handle as illustrated,
the solder may be drawn any way desired to make
special joints in awkward places, where the point of an
ordinary soldering bit could not be used.</p>

<h3>Sweating.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;In the preceding <a href="#Page17">chapter</a> it was shown
how useful <a href="#Ref03">sweating</a> is, when accomplished with the
help of the bit. In blowpipe work, also, this method
is of much utility, particularly in delicate work where
portions have to be joined up in very precise relations.
After tinning the joint faces the pieces are secured in
accurate relationship with binding wire, or by bolts or
screws or other means, or a soldering clamp is
employed, having jaws which clamp the pieces and
enable them to be adjusted to the exact locations
desired, and the flame then brought to bear until the
work is hot enough to cause the solder to run.</p>

<p>An example of the usefulness of sweating occurs in
the making or repairing of metal name plates having
superimposed brass, copper, or other metallic letters.
The plate having been flattened and polished and the
letters cut out, filed and finished, the backs of the
letters must be rendered chemically clean by careful
scraping, and are next &#8220;tinned&#8221; with soft solder.
The tinning may be done in several ways, but the
easiest is by the blowpipe, using resin oil as flux.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page55">[55]</span></p>

<p>Each letter may be placed in succession on a lump of
charcoal, using plenty of the resin oil, and applying
the flame of the blowpipe to the surface while one
hand holds the charcoal and the other the strip of
solder. To prepare the solder, which is sold in sheets
by the pound, cut some strips <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>3</sub> in. wide. Take hold
of one end 1 in. from the end, and with a sharp knife
scrape the surface, drawing the knife edge downwards.
Do not use the last 2 in. of the strip, as the handling
of this part makes it chemically unclean. The greater
part of the solder should be about the edges of the
letters. The next operation is to solder the letters to
the brass plate. As the brass plate also must be
chemically clean, the parts where the letters are to go
should be lightly scraped. Having ruled parallel lines
in order to get the letters in line, lay each down in
its proper place, and draw a pencil line round it; then
with a scraper just remove the surface of the brass
where the letters are to be soldered. A thin piece of<span class="pagenum" id="Page56">[56]</span>
solder is now placed underneath each letter, and each
in turn is fixed in its place and secured with a loop
of binding wire screwed up tight. Nothing now
remains to be done but to apply the blowpipe flame
and resin oil, when the solder will run underneath the
letters. It is better to set the plate on some small
lumps of charcoal. When the letters appear to be
set fast, remove the plate and boil it in a solution of
potash, about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> lb. to 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> gal. of water, and clean in
dry sawdust. The resin oil may be made by dissolving
resin in sweet oil by gentle heat, until the oil will
cause the solder to run.</p>

<h2><span class="chapno">CHAPTER VI</span><br />
<span class="chaptitle">Soldering Aluminium</span></h2>

<p>It is well known to those accustomed to the art of
soldering that there is no solder which operates with
aluminium in the same way that ordinary solders
operate with tinplate, copper, brass, etc. Aluminium
soldering presents so many difficulties that it has been
thought desirable to devote a separate chapter to the
subject.</p>

<p>There is more than one reason for the difficulty
encountered. Aluminium does not alloy readily with
solders at temperatures as low as other metals require;
and, secondly, aluminium alloys with lead solders only
with great difficulty, and with but a small proportion
of lead at that. Consequently, lead solders are not
suitable for aluminium. Another and even more
serious reason is in respect to the refractory oxide which
forms at soldering temperatures, and which is undoubtedly
responsible for most of the trouble.</p>

<p>The soldering of aluminium is one of the most
debated subjects in metal working. Almost as soon
as aluminium was prepared on a large scale, it was
discovered that the ordinary solders and fluxes did not
answer with it. Either pure tin or pure zinc will wet
aluminium, and can, therefore, be used as solder for
it; experience shows that the tin soon falls apart, while<span class="pagenum" id="Page58">[58]</span>
zinc by itself is brittle and discolours badly. The
failure of tin is due to the fact that it forms with the
aluminium an alloy that is decomposed by the action
of the oxygen present in the air.</p>

<p>Although aluminium is popularly supposed to be
non-oxidisable, really the surface is covered with a
very thin film of oxide, which prevents solder from
alloying with the metal. Aluminium when heated
rapidly oxidises. It is customary to scrape the metal
before and during the soldering; and although some
workers say that it is useless to scrape before soldering
because oxidation immediately starts again, it is
obvious that a thin film is more easily penetrated than
a thick one. Often it answers to scrape with the
copper bit during the soldering, previously rubbing off
the oxide with emery cloth. The work should, if
possible, be backed with asbestos, to keep up heat in
the metal. To discover whether the surface is
thoroughly tinned, wipe off lightly, and the untinned
parts will then soon become apparent. If the oxide
is not scraped off beforehand, it will probably mix
with the solder and form a scum, which will make a
neat flow difficult. Scum should be lightly removed
with an old knife blade. It is essential to &#8220;tin&#8221; every
part to be joined, as the solder will not take on any
spot that has not been rubbed in some way, unless
previously coated.</p>

<h3>Solders for Aluminium.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;Hundreds of aluminium
solders have been invented, naturally all claimed to
be strong and durable, the alloys containing various<span class="pagenum" id="Page59">[59]</span>
metals, such as aluminium, antimony, bismuth,
cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, manganese, silver,
phosphor tin, tin, and zinc. A <a href="#Ref04">table</a> of the most
approved aluminium solders is here given.</p>

<p>Many of the best solders for aluminium contain a
small proportion of phosphor tin. A molten alloy containing
phosphorus placed on aluminium tends to
absorb oxygen from the impure film as well as the
surrounding air.</p>

<p>In making the solders here given, it is advisable
to avoid loss of the more easily volatile of the metals
by adopting the following precautions: The aluminium
is melted first, the zinc is added in small pieces, then
tin in small pieces, and lastly the phosphor tin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page60">[60]</span></p>

<p>Inasmuch as zinc alloys with aluminium more
readily than does any of the common metals, solders
that will readily &#8220;tin&#8221; aluminium generally contain
zinc in varying proportions. The solders found most
satisfactory contain zinc, tin, aluminium, and a very
small proportion of phosphor tin; but they do not run
very freely or fuse so readily as the ordinary tin and lead
solders, and it is necessary to use a higher temperature,
so high, in fact, that difficulty is found in using these
solders with a soldering bit, and it is generally necessary
to use a blowlamp.</p>

<p>While there is no solder that allows aluminium to
be soldered with the facility and success experienced
with other metals, that of Richard&#8217;s is extensively used,
and seems to have given as good results as any. It
consists of the following ingredients: Tin 29 parts
zinc 11 parts, aluminium 1 part, and 5 per cent.
phosphor tin 1 part&mdash;practically the same as that given
in the last line of the table. This solder has withstood
the test of time better than many of the patented
solders, and can be used in jointing aluminium to
aluminium, also aluminium to copper or brass, and
without the use of a flux. In making the solder it is
advisable to avoid loss of the more easily volatile of the
metals. The aluminium should be melted first, then
the zinc, tin, and phosphor tin in the order named.</p>

<p>When using phosphorus instead of phosphor tin in
the making of aluminium solder, it will first be necessary
to incorporate it with the tin, for which purpose
take a length of 1-in. gas barrel, attach a screwed<span class="pagenum" id="Page61">[61]</span>
cap at one end, and close the opposite end with a tin
(not tin-plate) plug. Remove the screwed cap, and,
having carefully dried between blotting paper the
proper proportion of phosphorus, insert the latter in
the tube and replace the cap. Now put the plugged
end of the tube into the molten tin; this will melt the
plug of tin and so allow the phosphorus to come in
contact with the molten metal. The ingot of
phosphor tin formed is afterwards alloyed with the
other ingredients, as already explained.</p>

<h3>Fluxes for Aluminium.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;A large variety of fluxes
have been tried with more or less success, namely,
borax, copper chloride, lithium chloride, paraffin
resin, sal-ammoniac, stearin, silver chloride, tin
chloride, venetian turpentine, tallow, vaseline, and
zinc chloride. Stearin is undoubtedly the most
reliable of them all, but no flux is needed for solders
containing phosphorus, which is itself a flux.</p>

<h3>The Soldering Bit.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;The average temperature required
to make a satisfactory and thoroughly sweated
joint in aluminium is from 650&deg; F. to 680&deg; F., according
to the size of the article. A blowpipe or blowlamp
will be of great value, and is frequently preferable
to a bit. Should a bit be used, see that it is of
aluminium or nickel instead of copper, the point and
the soldered joint being kept much cleaner whilst
removing the film of oxide during the soldering operation.
Another advantage is that the point or &#8220;face&#8221;
of the bit can be &#8220;tinned&#8221; with the same flux as that
which is used for the joint. More care must be taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page62">[62]</span>
in the manipulation of the aluminium soldering bit
owing to its lower melting temperature than the copper
and nickel bits.</p>

<h3>The Process of Soldering Aluminium.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;The soldering
of aluminium must be performed quickly to be
satisfactory, as the metal, if not coated at the first
attempt, may be injuriously affected. &#8220;Tinning&#8221; the
parts required to be soldered first is another important
factor; also the distance of the overlap of the joints
should not exceed more than <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> in., so as to allow the
solder to flow thoroughly through; it does not flow so
readily as when soldering other metals.</p>

<p>In soldering large pieces, where the ordinary overlap
is not allowable, and where a butt joint would be
weak, fit the pieces together as at <span class="smcapall">A</span> (<a href="#Fig45">Fig. 45</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig45">
<img src="images/illo063.png" alt="" width="450" height="93" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 45.&mdash;Aluminium Fitted Together for Soldering</p>
</div>

<p>Solder always flows towards the hottest point.
This tendency enables one to direct its course under
the blowpipe or blowlamp flame. A large flame should
only be employed in &#8220;heating&#8221; up the part to be
soldered on large and heavy work. With a small
pointed flame directly on the solder and the parts on
which it rests, the solder will flow quickly, and leave
a smooth, even surface at completion.</p>

<p>Some aluminium solders now on the market are so
hard that it is necessary to heat them and the work
to redness before they melt. Sheet aluminium is
easily warped by heat, and also contracts badly. If the
solder is too high in melting point, the metal must also
be brought to that point to cause proper union. If a
hole is being filled in, the body of the metal on heating<span class="pagenum" id="Page63">[63]</span>
expands all round and partly closes the hole; also
both the solder and the patch whilst hot are slightly
expanded. In cooling, the hole enlarges, the patch
contracts, and the solder also contracts; cracks result.
The body of the work, if not exactly evenly made, will
warp, which is fatal to engine and similar work. By
using a low-heat solder (melting point, about 700&deg; F.)
these troubles should be avoided.</p>

<h3>Soldering Aluminium to Copper or Brass.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;Aluminium
can be readily soldered to copper or brass
with fine solder (2 parts of tin and 1 part of lead): tin
the metals, using stearin as flux previous to making
the required joint. It is essential that both the
&#8220;tinning&#8221; and soldering should be thoroughly done.
Do not expect the solder to pull the joint together, but
see that the joint is kept under slight pressure until the
solder is hard, otherwise the joint will not be perfect.
Many workmen refuse to place any reliance in such
joints.</p>

<p>Finally, it seems very likely that, at any rate as
regards factory work, the use of solder on aluminium
objects will be wholly discarded in the future in favour
of fusion welding or autogenous soldering, in which
process no alloy is interposed between the surfaces to
be joined. Information on the subject is given towards
the end of this book.</p>

<h3>Plumbers&#8217; Solder.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;As already stated, coarse, or
plumbers&#8217; wiping solder, is made in the proportion of
2 of lead to 1 of block tin. Care must be taken that
the lead is quite pure and free from any other metal,
as zinc-adulterated solder will be difficult to use, and
joints made with it on service pipes will not be sound.
In melting up scrap lead for making solder, only sheet
lead should be used, as the lead used in the manufacture
of sheets is much purer and contains a greater proportion
of pure pig lead. The scraps must be quite dry;
a damp piece dropped into a pot of molten metal
may cause a serious accident, as the contents of the pot
may be blown out.</p>

<p>To test the quality of solder when made, heat it as
for wiping a joint; the correct temperature is determined
by dropping a small piece of newspaper into the
pot, and if it quickly burns and catches alight the
solder is right for using. Next pour a small quantity
on to a cold but dry stone or cement floor. This, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page65">[65]</span>
cooling, should have a few spots on the surface about
the size of a threepenny-piece, and on the under side
should be bright nearly all over. Solder of this
quality would, if properly used, stand any pressure
without sweating. If the solder on the stone or
cement floor looks white on both sides, or has a few
small bright spots on the under side only, it is too
coarse and requires more tin. On no account should
the solder be heated to redness, as the tin rises to the
top and quickly turns to dross (see <a href="#Page11">p. 11</a>). If this
should happen to solder that is being used for service
pipes, it should be rectified by adding more tin.</p>

<p>To purify a pot of &#8220;poisoned&#8221; solder (solder that
contains zinc), melt, stir in a handful of common
sulphur or powdered brimstone until the mass is of
the constituency of wet sand, heat to the ordinary
working temperature, and carefully remove the crust<span class="pagenum" id="Page66">[66]</span>
that forms on the top, and the solder will then be fit
for use, except that a little tin must be added to it.
The presence of zinc in solder can be detected by the
difficulty of forming joints, the metal falling apart and
working very lumpy, and the joints when finished
having a dirty grey appearance.</p>

<p>When plumbers&#8217; solder is bought ready for use from
the manufacturers, it is usually in the form of casts of
eight bars, weighing about 56 lb. to the cast. The best
only should be used, as cheap solder is frequently the
cause of much trouble if used on high-pressure work,
and joints made with it are never of good appearance.
To test manufacturers&#8217; solder, wipe a joint with it,
and if it is of good quality it will work easily at a good
heat, and when cleaned off with tallow and a clean rag
it should be well covered with bright spots.</p>

<p>Brass fittings should not be tinned by dipping into
the solder pot, as brass being an alloy of zinc and
copper, the zinc may be melted into the pot with
disastrous results.</p>

<h3>Flux.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;The flux used is tallow, no other flux answering
the purpose so well, although mutton fat has been
used as a substitute. Plumbers often call tallow
&#8220;touch,&#8221; and they frequently use it in the form of
tallow candles, the cotton wicks coming in handy for
packing spindles of taps and slides of gas pendants.</p>

<p>An excellent plumbers&#8217; black, soil or smudge, can be
bought in packets, and requires only to be mixed with
water before using. Ordinary black consists of lampblack,
glue, and water. The black should be first<span class="pagenum" id="Page67">[67]</span>
mixed with water, afterwards adding the glue, which
must have been previously melted in a glue-pot.
Simmer this for a time to remove surplus water. Test
the black on a piece of sheet lead and dry off slowly.
If it chips, add more black, but if it rubs off add glue.</p>

<p>The black should be made in small quantities, as it
deteriorates if kept.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 49.&mdash;Marking-gauge for use on Pipe Ends</p>
</div>

<p>Another recipe is to place in the pot <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> lb. of size
or diluted molten glue and a little water; gently warm
until the size dissolves, but do not boil. Mix <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> cub.
in. of chalk ground to a fine powder with a pennyworth
of lampblack, and then with a pallet knife incorporate
some of the melted size with the mixture on
a flat board or stone to form a thin paste, after which
place the whole in the pot, warm, and stir together
thoroughly. Test as before. Old and thick soil is
thinned with porter or stout, but do not add too much
or the soil will become so sticky that the solder will
cling to it. A little brown sugar, or a little stout,
added to the black will make it more tenacious, and
cause it to dry with a slightly glossy surface. Some<span class="pagenum" id="Page68">[68]</span>
plumbers soil their joints after they are made, with
black japan or thinned Brunswick black. But it is
doubtful whether the effect is so good as when a
&#8220;dead&#8221; black, such as given by ordinary soil, is used.</p>

<h3>The Cloths.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;Solder cloths for underhand joints
should be from <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. to <sup>7</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> in. wider than the joint for
which they are to be used, and about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. longer than
they are wide. Most plumbers use the same cloths for
underhand and upright, but it is preferable to use a
special cloth for 4-in. upright joints with the length
1 in. less than the width. For getting up the heat of
an underhand joint on a small pipe a larger cloth may
be used until the worker is sufficiently skilled in joint
wiping not to burn his fingers when using the correct
size. For 3-in. joints and upwards a large cloth must
be used first to get up the heat, the wiping cloth
being kept warmed and ready for use when the heat is
right. This large cloth, as used by some plumbers, is
often long enough to lay on the worker&#8217;s arm, but
this is clumsy to use when the joint to be wiped is in a
cramped position, and is liable to let the pipe get burnt,
as the metal it holds cannot be readily distributed round
the joint; 8 in. by 9 in. is a good size to practise with
on the bench, and as more skill is obtained it can be
reduced to 7 in. by 7 in. A diagonal strap should be
stitched to the back to take the little finger and thumb;
the position for this can be obtained by laying the cloth
face downwards and placing the hand on it with the
finger slightly spread; the wrist should be over the
right-hand corner, so that when the cloth is being used<span class="pagenum" id="Page69">[69]</span>
the edge is readily kept parallel with the sides of the
pipe. Branch cloths are made from 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. to 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in.
wide and about half as long again in width. These
cloths should be about seven thicknesses of material,
all others being nine or ten.</p>

<p>White moleskin cloth is obtained from the tailor&#8217;s
for making these solder cloths, is usually 1 yd.
wide, and costs about 3s. per square yard. The usual
method of making cloths is to cut a strip down the
selvedge of the material and fold up the strip till the
desired size is obtained; it can then be cut off the
piece, and any odd ends left may be used for packing
a larger cloth. Another method is to cut a square
piece the required size, and then fold it three times
each way. This makes a rather clumsy cloth for small
sizes, but makes a very good &#8220;blanket.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Horizontal or Underhand Joints.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;For making
a successful wiped joint, the ends to be joined must be
a good fit and the temporary fixing must be sufficiently
strong so that the joints will not be broken in the
process of wiping. These two points should be always
strictly attended to. Service pipes should be tightly
pressed home one in the other, the cupped or female
end shaved inside with a knife, but not close in as is
the case with soil or waste pipe; this allows the solder
to fill up the cavity, which effectually prevents any
tendency to sweat. This principle is followed up by
some plumbers with branch joints on small size service
pipes, the male end being worked in with a twisting
motion, to prevent any solder getting into the pipes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page70">[70]</span>
All other pipe joints should be closed, the female end
being tightly worked in round the male end of pipes as
an extra precaution against the solder getting inside.
It is a good plan to black the inside of waste and soil
pipes, so that the solder will not adhere if any should
get through when making the joint. <a href="#Fig50">Fig. 50</a> shows
the wiping of an underhand joint.</p>

<p>Beginners often spend a lot of time practising
&#8220;rolling&#8221; underhand joints. This is bad practice, and
will be of no use in wiping fixed joints. Little advice
can be offered with regard to the actual wiping, constant
practice being the essential thing. See that the
solder is at the correct heat. This is readily found by
dropping a piece of newspaper into the pot, and, if it
quickly browns, the solder is ready for use. If the
solder is used too hot it will quickly burn holes in the
pipe, and if not hot enough a heat cannot be properly
worked up, and the cloth may get torn trying to move
hard metal. For underhand joints pour on steadily
with a circular motion on to the sides of the joint, and
on to the soil at the ends of the joint, until sufficient
solder in a molten condition can be brought up to cover
the top of the joint with the cloth, which is held
underneath it; then pour steadily all over the solder
until it runs back again. Repeat this continuously
until the solder can be worked in a substantial body all
round the joint without any hard solder being left at the
underneath edges. Give the joint a last pour on, and
wash all the solder into the cloth. Bring the solder
smartly on to the top, and quickly work it all round the<span class="pagenum" id="Page71">[71]</span>
joint with the wiping cloth, using two fingers of one
hand for the top and back edges, and the index fingers
of both hands for the underneath part. The top of
the joint should be roughly shaped first and the surplus<span class="pagenum" id="Page72">[72]</span>
metal brought over the back to the underneath; this
should be worked into the bottom of the joint with a
slight sideways motion. The extra body of metal
should be used to warm up any hard edges, the surplus
being brought up again to the top and quickly thrown
off to the back.</p>

<h3>Upright Joints.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;These are more trying to the
worker&#8217;s patience but are the easier to wipe. After
the pipe has been fixed in position, a lead collar should
be fixed a few inches below the joint to catch the
surplus metal. A piece of stout string tied by a half
hitch round the pipe will prevent any leakage of the
solder. In working up the heat of an upright joint,
care should be taken to work steadily round the joint
so that the heat is the same throughout. After sufficient
metal has been splashed on with the splash stick
and ladle, and the metal is at a moving heat, roughly
shape up the joint with the splash stick, keeping the
metal fairly high on the joint; then splash on a little
more hot metal all round. A warm cloth is now used
to shape up the joint by bringing the lower metal up to
the higher part, after which start to wipe first with the
hand as far round the back of the joint as possible and
bring the surplus metal to the front, the cloth being
held by the thumb and the index and little fingers; then
change the cloth to the left hand and repeat the operation.
The joint should be finished off at the back,
although if quickly done the finish off should not be
apparent. The collar must now be taken off and the
solder it contains melted with a plumber&#8217;s iron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page73">[73]</span></p>

<p>A plumber&#8217;s iron can be used to good purpose on
these joints, especially if they are out of doors and the
weather is rough. The iron must be heated to redness
and well filed up.</p>

<p>Where possible, all joints to be wiped in their permanent
position are sprung away from the wall and
temporarily fixed with steel points made from <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>-in.
hexagon steel about 9 in. long and drawn out to a point<span class="pagenum" id="Page74">[74]</span>
at one end. In some cases, more particularly soil-pipe
work, the pipes cannot be fixed away from the wall;
a hole must then be cut into the wall about 4 in. back
and about 12 in. square to allow the joint to be properly
made at the back.</p>

<h3>Wiped Joint between Lead and Cast-iron Pipes.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;In
wiping a lead pipe to a cast-iron pipe perhaps the
best practice is to file clean the end of the cast-iron
pipe first and then coat with pure tin, sal-ammoniac
being used as a flux. The pipe then is washed to
remove the sal-ammoniac, and afterwards &#8220;retinned,&#8221;
using resin and grease as a flux. A plumber&#8217;s joint
then is wiped in the usual way. It is necessary to
take great pains to make a good sound strong joint
between the two metals, but even then in the course of
time (it may be only a few years) the iron will come
out of the solder. The first sign of decay will be a red
ring of iron rust showing at the end of the joint. This
rust will swell a little and cause the end of the soldering
to slightly curl outwards. Eventually the rust will
creep between the solder and the iron and destroy the
adhesion of the one to the other. The joint would
eventually become a loose ring on the iron pipe, but
not on the lead pipe, as the expansion of lead and
solder do not differ to any great extent. Only those
metals that alloy together can be satisfactorily joined
by soft soldering, and the solder should contain as great
a proportion as possible of the metals to be united.</p>

<h2><span class="chapno">CHAPTER VIII</span><br />
<span class="chaptitle">Hard-soldering with Silver Solder</span></h2>

<p>Hard-soldering is chiefly of two kinds, brazing and
silver-soldering, the former being employed for iron
and steel, the solder used being known as &#8220;spelter,&#8221;
a brass alloy which can be obtained in various degrees
of fineness. For copper, brass, and nickel silver,
alloys containing silver are the best solders. In both
forms of hard-soldering, the flux is borax.</p>

<p>The methods of silver-soldering vary with the size
of the work. A jeweller may hold the work in his
hand, on the end of a piece of binding wire or on a
square of charcoal, the heat being applied by a mouth
blowlamp from a horizontal gas jet, as already
described. Larger work demands a flame of greater
intensity, and sufficient air can be supplied only by a
footblower or similar device, or, as an alternative, from
the flame of a suitable blowlamp.</p>

<h3>Silver Solder.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;This can be purchased at prices up
to 3s. 6d. or so per ounce in sheet form, about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>32</sub> in.
thick. Where the solder is melted down by the
amateur, a good way to obtain the sheet form is to
turn the globule of molten metal on to the bench and
to place a flat iron on it; but the result will not be
equal to a rolled ingot.</p>

<p>An old shop method of making silver-solder is to<span class="pagenum" id="Page76">[76]</span>
melt up old silver (using current silver coinage is an
expensive method of obtaining the silver, and is said
to be illegal) with some <i>brass</i> pins, not the iron ones so
common now.</p>

<p>According to W. H. Jubb, two solders compulsory
for silver articles that have to be sent to assay for hallmarking
are: (1) 12 parts standard silver and 1 part
brass; (2) 6 parts standard silver and 1 part brass.
No. 1 has a low melting point, and is termed &#8220;quick,&#8221;
and No. 2, which requires a higher temperature, is
called &#8220;stark&#8221; (in some parts of the country, &#8220;fine&#8221;),
but the use of this term here is misleading. No. 2
should be used at the first heating and No. 1 at the
second. These should make ideal solders for
beginner&#8217;s use, as the chances of burning the work,
even thin brass, are almost nil.</p>

<p>(3) 2 parts brass, 1 part standard silver; (4) 5 parts
brass, 2 parts standard silver. Whereas Nos. 1 and 2
are &#8220;silver solders,&#8221; Nos. 3 and 4 are termed &#8220;German
silver solders,&#8221; as they are not so white and are used
on German or nickel silver (an alloy of copper and
nickel). Both Nos. 3 and 4 are good, have a comparatively
low melting point, are much less expensive
than Nos. 1 and 2, and, if plenty of wet borax is used,
will &#8220;strike up&#8221; well. No. 3 is recommended.</p>

<p>&#8220;Standard silver&#8221; is about 95 per cent. pure silver.
Old &#8220;sterling silver&#8221; is 92&middot;5 per cent. pure silver.</p>

<p>In making any of the above solders the brass and
silver should be melted together, and care should be
taken to see that the metal is clean beforehand.<span class="pagenum" id="Page77">[77]</span>
Where large quantities of solder are made, the metals
are scoured with emery cloth before they are put into
the crucible.</p>

<h3>Requisites for Silver-soldering.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;For light jobs in
silver-soldering the special tools and materials required
are as follow: Suitable gas jet or other flame, mouth
blowpipe, scraper, jar containing a sulphuric acid
&#8220;pickle,&#8221; piece of slate, camel-hair brush, pieces of
lump borax, two grades of silver solder, charcoal block,
iron binding wire.</p>

<p>The pickle is made by pouring 1 part of common
sulphuric acid into 20 parts of water, and its function
is to remove all dirt and borax from the metal.
Silver-soldered articles should not be thrown into the
pickle until they are nearly cold, as otherwise the joints
may crack, but in the preparatory annealing (that is,<span class="pagenum" id="Page78">[78]</span>
softening) of plain metal, wire, rod or tubing, the
article may be put into the pickle when hot&mdash;but take
care of the splashes! Plunging hot copper or brass
into cold water does not have the effect of hardening
it. Before placing a job in the pickle, remove any
iron binding, as this is immediately attacked by
the acid.</p>

<p>Often it is advisable to heat the metal and put it
&#8220;through the pickle&#8221; before working on it, especially
in the case of tubing that has been lying by for some
time and has become dirty.</p>

<p>For heavier work, a foot-bellows and gas blowpipe,
or else a blowlamp, are essential. An &#8220;&AElig;tna&#8221; paraffin
blowlamp with horizontal burner will be found quite
satisfactory, although, of course, if a gas supply is
available in the workshop the user will find that a foot-bellows
and blowpipe are more convenient. A blowlamp
or blowpipe requires a suitable tray or &#8220;forge&#8221;
of sheet-iron in which coke and odd pieces of brick or
tile may be laid and used to pack round the object
whilst the flame is being played on the part to be
soldered.</p>

<a href="#Fig57">57</a>) and a brass pricker (<a href="#Fig58">Fig. 58</a>).</p>

<h3>Preparing the Borax Flux.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;Make up the flux on
the slate by rubbing on it a piece of the lump borax
moistened with water. This paste may be applied
with the camel-hair brush to the parts to be jointed.
The flux prevents the oxidisation of the surfaces, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page79">[79]</span>
would resist the amalgamation of the metals and the
solder.</p>

<h3>The Method of Silver-soldering.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;In hard-soldering
with silver solder, first file or scrape the parts
bright, and cover them and the solder with the borax
paste. Heat gently at first so as to harden the borax;
then continue to heat by blowpipe until a red heat is
reached, at which the solder will run. The secret is
to blow continuously until the solder runs, and not to
stop half-way.</p>

<p>For soldering a silver watch case, an ordinary easy-running
silver solder, which melts at a lower heat than
silver, will do. But to make sure, shred the solder
into very thin strips, and apply plenty of borax to them
as well as to the joint to be united. Use the blowpipe
gently at first so as to bake the borax, then heat the
case all over almost to the melting point of the solder,
and direct the flame to the part to be soldered until
the solder runs and glistens. Cease blowing instantly,
and plunge the case into a solution of sulphuric acid 1
part and water 10 parts, to whiten it; then wash in
hot water and dry in sawdust. Be careful to remove all
steel springs before soldering the case.</p>

<h3>Soldering Small Work with Paillons.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;These are
small squares, say, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> in., of sheet silver solder, made
by using the snips as in <a href="#Fig61">Fig. 61</a>, and prepared by well
covering with the borax paste. Each paillon is placed
in position with the tip of the brush, this job requiring
a little practice. The solder should be clean, and if not,
should be made so by passing through the fire and<span class="pagenum" id="Page80">[80]</span>
pickling. The work with the paillons in position
should be slowly heated by blowing the gas jet on a
part of the job farthest away from the solder; the
borax will dry, and should the solder have moved,
replace it with a suitable tool or the point of the wet
camel-hair brush. The heat must not be applied too
suddenly at first, otherwise the borax will boil up and
push off the pieces of solder. The heat may be
increased when the bubbling has ceased. Do not hold
the work too far away, or it will get dirty in the smoke
of the flame, or yet too near, else the gas will not be
used to advantage. As the work begins to get hot,
slowly work the flame towards the joint until the solder
melts and runs into the joint. Give it now a little
extra heat to get the solder thoroughly down into the
crevices, and then let the work cool down. When
nearly cold twist off the iron binding wire and put the
job into the pickle. Leave the work in the pickle about
ten minutes, when all the borax will be dissolved.</p>

Paillons</p>
</div>

<h3>Larger Work.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;An example of silver-soldering
larger work is the joining together of two pipes, one
smaller than the other. The best course to adopt is to
file or scrape the end of the smaller and the inside of
the larger (reaming and filing them if necessary) until
a good fitting joint is obtained, as in <a href="#Fig59">Figs. 59</a> and <a href="#Fig60">60</a>.
A strip of solder is then cut off, and, after the joint is
well coated with borax paste, this solder may be
wound round the smaller pipe. If the joint is soldered
in a vertical position, the larger pipe should be the
lower. The heat should be conserved by laying the<span class="pagenum" id="Page81">[81]</span>
work in the coke and building the same round, or, if
the work is too large or the joint in an awkward part
of the pipe, a shield of tin plate or iron should be
placed behind the joint so that the flame is thrown
back on to the work. Should the pipe be attached in
close proximity to the joint to a heavy piece of metal,
then warm this metal up first, otherwise all the heat
will travel to this part, and the work will take much
longer to get to the proper temperature. In all cases
where one part of the joint is of heavier substance than
the other, that part should receive the greater amount
of attention from the flame.</p>

<h3>Quenching Silver-soldered Work.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;Many craftsmen
object to the cooling of the work by plunging it
into water or pickle whilst it is hot; but no damage or
cracking of the joint occurs, it is thought, if the work
is not plunged when it is red hot or anywhere near red
hot. Plunging into a pickle certainly cracks the burnt-in
borax, which can be readily removed and the joint
examined to better advantage. Many a silver-soldered<span class="pagenum" id="Page82">[82]</span>
joint has been passed as quite sound when it has only
been the borax that has been stopping the interstices,
and only after it has been placed under service for some
time does the faulty joint make itself apparent.</p>

<p>Silver-soldering cannot be done on work that has
been previously soft-soldered unless the soft-soldered
part is first cut away; but, of course, soft-soldering
can be readily accomplished after silver-soldering or
brazing so long as the work is clean and all burnt borax
is first removed.</p>

<h3>Removing Soldering Marks.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;Solder will run away
from a part of a joint instead of running into it when
the edges of the joint have been imperfectly cleaned
preparatory to the application of flux and solder; also,
if some dirt has got into the flux, or on the paillons of
solder employed. Another cause is unequal heating
of the joint, or allowing it to expand too much whilst
being heated. The resulting fire marks may be
removed by warming the articles on a pan over gas,
and plunging them whilst warm into the sulphuric
acid pickle. Or the marks may be removed in a hot
and strong solution of potassium cyanide, and the
polish renewed by a light polishing with a revolving
swansdown mop and rouge composition.</p>

<h2><span class="chapno">CHAPTER IX</span><br />
<span class="chaptitle">Soldering Gold and Silver Jewellery</span></h2>

<p>Two methods of soldering are in common use among
jewellers and silversmiths. Soft-soldering is done
with fine solder (1 of lead and 2 of tin), and is used for
articles that will not bear much heating. The metal
is filed or scraped clean and bright where the solder
is wanted to run, killed spirit is applied, and a little
solder is run on the surfaces by applying gentle heat.
Having thus been &#8220;tinned,&#8221; the parts are placed
together and heat applied until they unite, a spirit lamp
or a blowpipe being used. This is the sweating process,
already referred to a number of times.</p>

<p>For soldering catches and joints to cheap metal
brooches that have been silver-plated or gilt, the same
solder is used as in the above. Both catches and joints
can be cheaply purchased, hard-soldered on to small
plates, square, oval, or crescent shaped, to suit all kinds
of brooches. Take one of these and hold it with an
old pair of soldering tweezers in the flame of a spirit
lamp, and give it a coating of solder on its under side.
First wet it with the killed spirit, and then place a
small portion of solder on it, and hold it in the flame
until it flows all over the plate. It can be assisted to
flow evenly by a copper wire, which is also useful to
apply the acid flux. Having &#8220;tinned&#8221; the catch, clean<span class="pagenum" id="Page84">[84]</span>
(by scraping bright) the brooch, and place the catch in
position. Direct a gentle blowpipe flame to it until it
is seen to settle down and the solder flows. Then
wash it immediately in warm water to remove the acid
and dry in sawdust, kept in a warm place. Use as
little solder as possible, and only clean the brooch
where the solder is required to run. Attention to these
points will ensure a neat job.</p>

<p>Hard-soldering on jewellery, etc., is done with silver
or gold solder, and requires the articles to be heated to
a bright red. The parts are cleaned, and a paste of
borax and water is applied as a flux. A small piece of
the solder is also dipped in the borax paste and laid
over the join. Gentle heat is first applied to bake the
borax hard, then by the use of a blowpipe the parts
are raised to a red heat until the solder runs. The
instructions given in the preceding chapter apply
generally.</p>

<p>With regard to gold-cased jewellery, it is useless to
attempt to hard-solder gold that has the least trace of
soft solder or lead on it; the heat causes the lead to
heat into and rot the gold, and the articles will tumble
to pieces. The only way to mend, say, a gold-cased
lead ring is by soft-soldering a tin band or plate over
it, applying the heat very gently to avoid melting the
lead inside.</p>

<p>For hard-soldering a gold ring without discolouring
it, use solders containing gold, the precious metal in the
solder being afterwards laid bare by a process of
annealing and pickling. The solders are prepared to<span class="pagenum" id="Page85">[85]</span>
suit the quality of the gold to be soldered, so that they
may &#8220;colour&#8221; well and thus hide the joint. The following
is a list of coloured solders:</p>

<p>Best solder: Fine gold, 12<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> parts; fine silver, 4<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>
parts; copper, 3 parts.</p>

<p>Medium: Fine gold, 10 parts; fine silver, 6 parts;
copper, 4 parts.</p>

<p>Common: Fine gold, 8<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> parts; fine silver, 6<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> parts;
copper, 5 parts.</p>

<p>The gold solder is cast in long ingots, rolled thin
and flat, and cut up or filed into dust, and thus
applied to the cleaned joints, using borax as a flux.
After the joint has been closed under a blowpipe flame,
the whole ring is annealed on an annealing plate to a
dull red heat, then cooled, pickled in acid, and
polished. The film of grease left by the polishing
process is washed off in hot soda water, and the ring
dried in hot sawdust. Hard-soldered rings may be
coloured with a film of electro-deposited gold.</p>

<p>If the gold is of common quality, under 12-carat,
to remove any excess solder make a mixture by reducing
to powder 1 oz. of green copperas and <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> oz. of saltpetre
and boiling in 5 oz. of water. This will crystallise
when cool. Redissolve the crystals in eight times their
bulk of muriatic acid. For use, add boiling water, and
place the gold in the hot mixture. For gold of 12-carat
or over, nitric acid and water (1 part of acid to 2 of
water) will dissolve the solder without injuring the
gold.</p>

<p>Gold solders used on gold articles are made from<span class="pagenum" id="Page86">[86]</span>
gold of the quality of the article&mdash;say, 18- or 15-carats&mdash;to
which is added <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>12</sub>th or more of silver and <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>24</sub>th
or more of copper. The quality of the solder is always
a trifle inferior to the metal on which it is used, so that
the solder may melt at a lower heat than the article.
The melting point of 18-carat gold is 1995&deg; F., of 15-carat
1992&deg;, and 9-carat 1979&deg;, while easy silver solder
melts at about 1802&deg; F. This shows that although 9- or
15-carat gold could be used to solder 18-carat, it is
not possible to use 18-carat to solder 15-carat. The
same principle applies to silver and brass; and the
quality of the solder has to be known before any
attempt should be made to carry out the actual soldering
of an article. Another important point is that thin
gold articles, like brooches, will not bear so hard a
solder as the same quality of gold will do when made
up solid, as in the case of a bangle ring. Solder for
18-carat and 15-carat is made thus: Take 1 dwt. of the
gold, and add 2 gr. fine silver and 1 gr. fine copper;
melt well together, and roll out thin. For 12-carat,
the addition of 3 gr. fine silver and 1 of fine copper to
the dwt. is advisable; while for 9-carat the most useful
solder is made from 1 part fine gold, 1 part fine copper,
and 2 parts fine silver.</p>

<p>Great care must be exercised in hard-soldering gem
jewellery, as the stones are likely to be injured.
Diamonds are the only stones that it is safe to heat to
redness in soldering. Fancy coloured stones, such as
rubies, emeralds, sapphires, topazes, amethysts,
garnets aquamarines, or pastes must not be made hot.<span class="pagenum" id="Page87">[87]</span>
A ring with any of these stones may be hard-soldered
at the back if the stones are covered up with a pad of
wet tissue paper to keep them cool; but if the soldering
has to be done anywhere near the stones, they must
all be taken out by un-setting.</p>

<p>Articles set with pearls, turquoises, opals, or cat&#8217;s-eyes
(these things are not really &#8220;stones&#8221;) will bear
no heat whatever, and must all be taken out before
soldering.</p>

<p>In cases where it is very desirable to leave the
stones in place, in order to prevent their bursting
when heat is applied to the jewellery, cut a juicy
potato into halves and make a hollow in both portions,
in which the part of the ring having jewels may fit
exactly. Wrap the jewelled portion in soft paper,
place it in the hollow, and bind up the closed potato
with binding wire. Now solder with easy-flowing gold
solder, the potato being held in the hand. Another
method is to fill a small crucible with wet sand, bury
the jewelled portion in the sand, and solder in the
usual way.</p>

<p>To restore the colour of gold or silver after soldering,
dip the articles while hot into pickling acid (1 part
of sulphuric acid to 10 parts of water); or put them in
a little acid in a pan and boil them in it. Here, again,
diamonds are the only stones that may be dipped hot,
and there is a slight risk even with them. Pearls, etc.,
must not touch the acid, either hot or cold.</p>

<p>After heating and pickling, all gold is of a pale
colour, and the commoner the gold the paler. However,<span class="pagenum" id="Page88">[88]</span>
18-carat gold may be restored to its original
colour in a few moments by buffing with rottenstone
and oil on a leather buff or on a brush, and following
with rouge in the same way; or it may be burnished if
the nature of the article permits this. Poorer qualities
of gold may be restored to their bright colour by the
same means, but this takes longer. Most 9-carat
articles are gilt to improve their colour, and after
soldering must be re-gilt to restore their original
appearance.</p>

<h2><span class="chapno">CHAPTER X</span><br />
<span class="chaptitle">Brazing</span></h2>

<p>Hard-soldering by brazing with spelter is used to a
very great extent in the metal industries, especially in
the manufacture of cycles and motor-cars. Although
several mechanical joints have been tried in cycle
manufacture, the greatest number of joints are made
by means of brazing solder. A joint made in this
manner is almost as strong as a weld, and the steel tube
itself will often break under a strain and the brazed
joint remain intact. Copper and brass tubes, when
well brazed, will stand a pressure of 40 lb. or more per
square inch.</p>

<h3>Spelter.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;Hard brazing solder (spelter) is somewhat
difficult to make. The metals have to be melted
in a crucible and cast at a proper heat, and while in a
certain condition have to be pounded or punned in a
mortar. This disintegrates the materials and forms
crystals of various sizes, some being as coarse as wheat
grains, varying in fineness down to that known as 0&nbsp;0,
which is very fine dust indeed, and used only on very
particular work, such as tubing <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> in. or <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> in. in
diameter. The quantity of 0&nbsp;0 from 1 cwt. of solder is
very small, the corresponding quantity of coarse grains
being much larger; so that unless a quantity is
required, it is cheaper to buy than to make. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page90">[90]</span>
necessary to employ the purest materials, and in
purchasing hard solder it is advisable to state the purposes
for which it is to be used.</p>

<p>As a general rule, a solder should melt at a heat just
under the melting point of the metals to be united.
Now, in ironwork, or with the steel used in cycle
work, this is impossible, for the melting points of these
two metals are too high to be effected by the bunsen
blowpipe or brazing hearth; but to join two metals in
which the melting point approximates very closely to
that of the solder requires great care in order that the
metals may not be fused and the join spoiled. The
reason why the melting point of solder should be about
the same as that of the metals being joined is apparent
when it is remembered that heat and cold, vibration
and concussion, tension and compression, have very
considerable effect on metals, and that if the expansion
and contraction of these under working conditions is
not nearly alike, disruption or opening of the joint will
follow.</p>

<p>Hard solders or spelters are mainly composed of
copper and zinc&mdash;that is, they are brass alloy&mdash;the
quality most extensively used consisting of equal parts
of copper and zinc. As the quantity of copper in the
solder is increased, so the fusing or melting point is
raised.</p>

<p>Ordinary copper melts at about 2,000&deg; F. and zinc
at about 840&deg; F., and a solder composed of equal parts
of each metal has therefore a high melting-point.</p>

<p>A very hard solder consists of equal parts of silver<span class="pagenum" id="Page91">[91]</span>
and copper. Generally, a spelter of different composition
is required for iron, copper, and brass work,
that for the latter being required more readily fusible
than that for the former. A suitable spelter for ironwork
is one composed of 2 parts copper and 1 part
zinc; a spelter for copper consists of 3 parts copper and
2 parts zinc; while equal parts of copper and zinc
make a suitable spelter for ordinary brass work. If a
very low melting point be required, a little silver should
be added to the last-given spelter.</p>

<h3>The Flux.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;Borax is the best-known flux for
brazing. It is beneficial, however, to have the borax
calcined (fused), as it settles down to its work immediately
when applied to the hot metal, whereas
uncalcined borax has a tendency to swell and fall off
the work.</p>

<p>Spelter is in the form of filings, a thin stick, or
wire. Filings are apt to be blown from the work.
Brazing is a very useful, and, if properly done, reliable,
method of joining two pieces of iron. A brazed joint is
considerably stronger than a soft-soldered one, and
easily resists temperatures that would cause ordinary
solder to run.</p>

<p>The process is not at all difficult if there is sufficient
heat, and, for those who have no gas laid on, the
purchase of a paraffin &AElig;tna brazing lamp can be
recommended. With this lamp, of course, the bellows
is not used, and only an iron hearth with asbestos cubes
is wanted; but gas should be used if available.</p>

<h3>The Method.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;For satisfactory brazing, thoroughly<span class="pagenum" id="Page92">[92]</span>
clean the surfaces to be joined, first with a file and then
with emery-cloth, and, if necessary, bind them together
with thin iron wire. A flux of borax and water mixed
up into a thick paste is smeared round the joint, which
should then be warmed to get rid of the moisture.
Heat the metal to a white heat, dip the spelter into
the borax paste, and apply to the part to be joined,
rubbing round the joint until the brass is seen to run,
when the heat can be cut off. The work should be
almost covered in the asbestos cubes, and the spelter
applied all round and not only in one place; failures to
unite the parts mostly result from insufficient heat or
cleaning of the parts.</p>

<h3>Brazing-lamps.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;These lamps are constructed to
burn benzoline or paraffin, and the more powerful
types are fitted with pumps so that air pressure may
be exerted on the oil. The paraffin or benzoline is
thus forced into the burner, and by passing through
the previously heated tubular coil is converted into gas,
which issues forth out of the gas nipple, mixes with
air, and then burns with a blue atmospheric flame of
high temperature. After filling the lamp, a torch
should be held under the burner to vaporise the oil,
and thus ignite the lamp, after which pressure is
applied by means of the pump. Do not start pumping
too soon&mdash;that is, before the burner is sufficiently hot
to vaporise the oil&mdash;or the oil itself will be forced
through the gas nipple. The flame may be regulated
at will, to suit the work in hand, after the burner has
become thoroughly hot to set the lamp fairly going.<span class="pagenum" id="Page93">[93]</span>
When brazing, lay the article to be brazed on some
broken coke, charcoal, or firebrick, and if the article is
comparatively heavy, cover it over with some small
pieces (to conserve the heat) except where the brazing
is required. After applying flux and spelter to the
previously cleaned metal, direct the flame of the lamp
on it, gently at first, until the spelter fuses and makes
the joint.</p>

<h3>Gas Blowpipe for Brazing.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;Brazing blowpipes
should be fitted with a combination air and gas
regulator, by means of which both the size and nature
of the flame can be adjusted to suit the work in hand.
When choosing a blowpipe it is always better to make
one rather larger than the work in hand necessitates&mdash;the
flame can be reduced when required; by this
means a margin of reserve is provided which is useful
in emergencies. A blowpipe whose dimensions are
10 in. long, having a <sup>5</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>-in. gas supply reduced to <sup>7</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> in.
at the nozzle, and a <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>-in. air supply reduced to <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> in.
at the nozzle, will braze ordinary latch keys and other
similar work if used with a No. 3 size blower. As
already stated, a paraffin, petrol or benzoline blowlamp
is a cheap and effective apparatus, especially where
the quantity of work to be done does not warrant
the outlay of a foot blower, gas blowpipe, etc.,
but gas has advantages over the liquid fuel, inasmuch
as the blowpipe is more under control.
The quantities of gas and air can be readily and
more delicately adjusted during the actual brazing
process, then as soon as the spelter fuses and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page94">[94]</span>
gas is turned off, the stream of cold air soon counteracts
any excessive heat.</p>

<h3>Making a Gas Brazing Hearth.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;The brazing
hearth can be bought ready-made, or can be cheaply
put together by the worker himself, the necessary
materials consisting of two bellows, some lead piping,
and an old packing case to support a large size frying-pan&mdash;about
1 ft. 4 in. by 1 ft. The bellows are fixed
one above the other, interconnected by a fixed lead
pipe, one pair of bellows worked by the foot pumping
air into the pair above it, from which the air is taken
to a bunsen blast burner by flexible tube. This bunsen
burner can also be easily and cheaply made, and as this
works very well and will be found useful for both
soldering and brazing, the following hints on making
it are given. First, get two ordinary large house
bellows about 1 ft. square, or larger if possible; the
larger the better. Next a good strong packing case
about 2 ft. long by 1 ft. 3 in. high and 10 in. wide is
required. One end of the box will form the base, and
to make it steadier two 1-in. boards should be screwed
across to protrude about 6 in. on each side, the front
one being considerably wider, as can be seen at <span class="smcapall">T</span> (<a href="#Fig62">Fig.
62</a>), which shows the apparatus with one of the case
sides removed. The packing case proper is denoted by
the letter <span class="smcapall">A</span>; the part <span class="smcapall">A S A</span> was formerly the bottom
of the case, but is now the back; and the top <span class="smcapall">A V A</span> was
the end of the packing case. Half-way between the
top and bottom a shelf <span class="smcapall">B</span> should be fixed, having a
large hole cut out of the middle at <span class="smcapall">G</span> to accommodate<span class="pagenum" id="Page95">[95]</span>
the union piece (seen in section), which holds the lead
air-pipe communicating from the lower bellows to the
upper.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig62">
<img src="images/illo095.png" alt="" width="450" height="501" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 62.&mdash;Home-made Brazing Hearth</p>
</div>

<p>In the back, near the bottom, at <span class="smcapall">S</span>, cut a hole for
the nozzle of one of the bellows, and above the shelf
cut another hole at <span class="smcapall">S</span><sup>1</sup> to take the nozzle of the other
bellows. The bottom bellows <span class="smcapall">C</span> should have the top
handle extended by a piece of stout bent iron <span class="smcapall">N</span> to act
as a pedal, and should be screwed to the base. A
central hole about 3 in. in diameter should be cut at <span class="smcapall">P</span>
to allow the air to reach the valve. Now get a piece of
lead pipe <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. inside diameter, and, having cut down
the nozzle to just under that diameter, force the mouth<span class="pagenum" id="Page96">[96]</span>
of the pipe over it as at <span class="smcapall">S</span>, and bend the pipe <span class="smcapall">F</span> as
shown, to reach the centre of the shelf <span class="smcapall">B</span> and enter the
hole <span class="smcapall">G</span> until flush with the top. Remove the lead pipe
and get a block of wood about 3 in. square. Cut off
the corners and bore a hole in the middle, so that the
lead pipe will just pass through it, and countersink the
hole. Broach out the mouth of the lead pipe until it
becomes bell-shaped and fits the block of wood, so that
its edge is flush with the wood when pressed hard
against it. This is clearly shown at <span class="smcapall">G</span>, where the dark
shading represents the wood block. Cut a leather
washer the size of the block, with a <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>-in. central hole,
and lay this over the hole in the bottom of the top
bellows where the leather flap valve is. Bore two
holes in the wood block, and screw this down tightly
to the bottom of the bellows, so that the bell-mouth of
the lead pipe faces the hole and has the leather between
it and the block. This should make an air-tight joint
for the fixing of the pipe to the bellows.</p>

<p>Next, push the nozzle of the bellows through the
hole <span class="smcapall">S</span><sup>1</sup>, and screw the bellows down tightly to the shelf
<span class="smcapall">B</span>. Join the lead pipe to the nozzle of the bottom
bellows, and make an air-tight joint with glue and
tape bound round. Between the top of the upper
bellows <span class="smcapall">D</span> and the top of the packing case at <span class="smcapall">V</span>, a stout
sofa spring <span class="smcapall">E</span> is fixed to keep the top bellows shut down
tight till air is pumped in from the bellows below.</p>

<p>From a screw near the top of the case stretch a
house-bell coil spring <span class="smcapall">M</span>, and attach its lower end to
the foot-plate or pedal <span class="smcapall">N</span>. This spring tends to keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page97">[97]</span>
the lower bellows open. When pressure is put on the
foot-plate <span class="smcapall">N</span>, air is pumped from the lower to the upper
bellows, and thence along the flexible pipe <span class="smcapall">R</span> to the
bunsen blast nozzle described in detail later. If it were
not for the upper bellows, the air would come to the
nozzle in puffs, but the spring <span class="smcapall">E</span> keeps the pressure
constant, and a steady blast is secured. The rubber
pipe <span class="smcapall">R</span> should be of sufficient length to reach the hand
conveniently, and allow room for movement.</p>

four iron stays or legs <span class="smcapall">H</span> must be used to raise it above
the top of the packing case as shown. These legs
should be screwed at one end to the sides of the case,
and at the other to the pan, and if a frying-pan is used,
the handle may be cut and bent to form a hook as at
<span class="smcapall">L</span>; it then acts as a support for the blast nozzle.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 63.&mdash;Blowpipe or
Blast Gas Nozzle<br />for
Brazing Hearth</p>
</div>

<p>For use with the brazing hearth, a blast gas nozzle
on the bunsen principle is required, and this is easily
made from two pieces of gas-piping, a right-angle
joint, and two mouthpieces to take flexible pipes.
First, get 1 ft. of <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>-in. brass (or iron) pipe and an
elbow, internally threaded at both ends. Cut 2 in. off
the brass pipe, and cut a thread at one end of the short
piece and one end of the long piece, to screw into the
elbow as shown in <a href="#Fig63">Fig. 63</a>. At the other end of the
long tube solder in a cock or mouthpiece to take a large
diameter flexible pipe from the gas bracket. Next get
1 ft. of <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>-in. brass pipe, and bend it to the shape shown<span class="pagenum" id="Page98">[98]</span>
at <span class="smcapall">B</span>, soldering a mouthpiece at <span class="smcapall">F</span> to take the smaller
diameter air-pipe <span class="smcapall">R</span> (<a href="#Fig62">Fig. 62</a>) from the bellows. Bore
a hole through the elbow <span class="smcapall">C</span>, and push the pipe in,
making a tight fit, and so that it passes centrally
through the larger brass tube until it nearly reaches
the end as shown at <span class="smcapall">D</span>. Run a shoulder of solder to
hold the small tube firmly in the larger one as at <span class="smcapall">E</span>,
and unite with a drop of solder the large tube <span class="smcapall">A</span> and the
small tube <span class="smcapall">B</span> where they cross at <span class="smcapall">G</span>.</p>

<p>The gas passes up the large pipe, and out at <span class="smcapall">D</span>, and
a blast of air is forced through the centre of the flame
through the small pipe <span class="smcapall">B</span>. The shape of the small pipe
allows of it being readily hung up on the hook <span class="smcapall">L</span> (<a href="#Fig62">Fig.
62</a>) when not in use. Instead of the mouthpiece shown
at <span class="smcapall">H</span> (<a href="#Fig63">Fig. 63</a>), a cock will be found more convenient;
but it should not be too small, or it will restrict the
flow of gas, which should be as great as possible. No
gas-cock should have less than <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>-in hole.</p>

<p>The &#8220;fuel&#8221; (heat conservers) consists of chunks or
cubes of asbestos, and when these are blown upon with
the gas flame, the heat is quite sufficient for moderately
heavy brazing. Be careful not to get any kinks in the
flexible tubes, or the air and gas will be reduced in
quantity, if not stopped altogether.</p>

<p>A square of thick asbestos (sheet) is useful for laying
on small articles whilst brazing, and a piece or two
of charcoal will be handy for silver-soldering.</p>

<h3>Brazing Iron and Steel.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;Before attempting to
braze either iron or steel the surfaces should be
thoroughly cleaned by filing or grinding, etc. Brass or<span class="pagenum" id="Page99">[99]</span>
copper may be cleaned by dipping in a solution of 1
part nitric acid and 2 parts of sulphuric acid. This
same solution can be used to remove the scale after
brazing. The parts should be fastened together in the
position they are to occupy when joined. The fastening
may be effected by the use
of wires, screws, bolts, clamps,
etc. If practicable, the parts
should be held in such a way
that they can be turned over
during the brazing process without
disturbing the relation of the
parts, thus affording a better
chance to apply the flux and
brazing material.</p>

<p>In brazing sheet metal, if the
seams are not required to stand
much working after soldering,
they may be joined edge to edge.
When seams are formed in this
way, little nicks, about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in.
apart, should be filed out along
the edges, so that the solder flowing through the
nicks will render the joint sound. If the seam
is to be worked after soldering, a small lap is
necessary to ensure adequate strength. To form seams
of this type, first thin the edge of the metal along the
ends that are to form the seams, about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> in. in from
the edge, so that when the two edges are lapped over
each other the combined thickness at the seams will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page100">[100]</span>
the same as the single thickness of the metal at other
parts. Cut a small cramp at the top and bottom of the
seam, and fit the opposite edge in these cramps. After
preparing the seams by either of the above methods,
fasten binding wire round the articles so as to hold
the seams securely in position. Now powder some
borax flux, mix equal parts of the borax paste and
grains of spelter, and along the seams place sufficient
of the mixture to solder them when melted. Some
dry borax should also be kept ready at hand, so that
a little may be taken and thrown on the solder at any
point where the material does not appear to be flowing
freely. Gently heat the article by some suitable
means, such as foot bellows and blowpipe, so that it
will expand equally, and not disarrange the seam; increase
the temperature until the metal is a dull red,
and the spelter runs. If necessary, with a piece of
wire flattened at one end gently rub the solder along
the seam until every part is joined.</p>

<h3>Brazing Copper Rod.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;For uniting two pieces of
copper rod, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in. or <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> in. in diameter, first prepare the
joint as at <span class="smcapall">A</span> in <a href="#Fig64">Fig. 64</a>, and file the surface of the
copper clean in the immediate vicinity of the joint. A
mixture of borax and water and spelter should now be
applied to the joint, which should rest on a small heap
of broken coke, the coke being also built round it.
The flame of the blow-lamp should be directed at first
on the coke surrounding the joint, and then gradually
brought to bear on the joint itself. If necessary, add
a little more spelter before any of it fuses, and when<span class="pagenum" id="Page101">[101]</span>
the copper begins to get red hot, throw just a pinch of
dry borax on the joint to facilitate matters.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 65.&mdash;Dovetailed Joint in Key Stem</p>
</div>

<h3>Brazing Key Stems.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;In brazing together the broken
parts of a key stem, first it is necessary to file the
fractured ends quite true; this may entail the shortening
of the key by <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in. or <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>
in., and as another <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in.
will be lost in making the joint, it may be advisable
to use another key bow having a longer piece of stem
than the one that was broken off. With a warding
file cut a dovetail on each of the ends to be joined, as
shown by <a href="#Fig65">Fig. 65</a>. A small, half-round file will assist
in making the edges true and square. The pieces must
interlock perfectly, and when this is the case, very
lightly hammer the joint, round which then bind seven
or eight turns of brass wire to act as spelter. Wet the
joint, sprinkle powdered borax on it (this is to serve
as the flux), and, holding the key in a pair of tongs,
place it in a clear part of a forge fire made with
charcoal, small coke, or coal cinders, and commence<span class="pagenum" id="Page102">[102]</span>
to blow steadily the forge bellows or blower. Failing
a forge fire, use a blowpipe, the key being placed on a
piece of charcoal or pumice-stone whilst the heat is
being applied. If the forge fire is used it is as well to
support the key on a guard of thick iron plate having
a hole in its centre over which is the joint to be brazed.
By this means the necessary local heating is obtained,
and much labour in cleaning the key afterwards is
avoided. On being heated, the borax swells and boils
up, and should be pressed down with a spatula, previously
dipped in cold water to prevent the hot borax
adhering to it; a suitable spatula is made by flattening
one end of a 1-ft. length of a <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>-in. round rod, having at
its other end an eye by which it may be hung when not
in use. With this spatula, also, powdered spelter may
be added to the joint if required. When the brass wire
begins to run, assist the flow by adding powdered
borax, and when all the brass has run into the joint,
rub off superfluous molten metal from underneath and
allow the joint to cool gradually. When cold, file up
and clean the stem of the key until only a thin bright
line of brass can be seen.</p>

<h3>Cycle Brazing.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;In cycle brazing, the first consideration
is the means of heating the heaviest joint
to a brazing heat. This may be done in several ways,
by a paraffin blow-lamp costing at least 35s. to 40s., or,
what is better, a gas blowpipe <sup>7</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> in. or 1 in. in diameter,
with at least <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. gas supply pipe and a fan or bellows
to supply the necessary air pressure. A small fan is
far preferable to a bellows of any description, the flame<span class="pagenum" id="Page103">[103]</span>
being steady and constant, and the operator being able
to devote his entire attention to the job. In the
absence of power, obtain a small circular double-blast
bellows and hearth, costing with blowpipe about &pound;5.</p>

<p>The brazing materials are brass spelter. No. 3 size,
or brass brazing wire and powdered borax; a tin to
hold the mixture of spelter and borax, and one for the
plain borax; a piece of iron wire about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in. by 18 in.,
flattened at one end to feed the spelter and borax to
the joints; and a brazier&#8217;s brush, which is desirable,
but not absolutely necessary, to brush the superfluous
borax and brass from the outside of the joint as soon as
it is removed from the hearth; this saves much work
in filing up, and saves the files immensely. Do not
purchase the borax ready powdered, but buy lump
borax, as that purchased ready powdered is likely to be
adulterated. In making the brazing mixture, use
about equal parts, in bulk, of No. 3 spelter and borax.</p>

<p>In preparing the work for brazing, see that the surfaces
are bright, clean, and free from scale. The joints
should be a good tight fit, free from shake, and where
a joint such as the back forks to the bridge lugs is
being made, see that the tube edges fit close up to the
shoulder of the lugs all round, and do not depend on
the brass to fill up a badly fitted joint.</p>

<p>The chief things to observe are to make a sound
joint the full depth of the lug, and not merely to get a
thin film of brass round the outer edge. To do this,
the flame should be directed on to the thickest part of
the lug first before getting the tube too hot, and feeding<span class="pagenum" id="Page104">[104]</span>
the joint with borax before the metals get hot
enough to scale. As soon as the lug and tube begin to
get a dull red, feed with borax only, then with brass
and borax, when it should flow almost like water and
penetrate to the deepest part of the joint.</p>

<p>Another very important thing is not to &#8220;burn&#8221; the
tube by getting it too hot, which will spoil it and cause
an early fracture. If the above method of heating the
lug first is observed, and the tube near the lug kept
&#8220;wet&#8221; with borax to prevent it scaling, this should
not happen.</p>

<p>Where the joint to be brazed lends itself to inside
loading with the spelter, the work should be so placed
on the hearth that the brass inside, when it melts, will
tend to flow to the outside of the joint. Then if borax
only is used on the outside until brass appears round
the edges, it will be fairly certain that a sound joint will
result. As soon as this comes through, feed a little
brass-and-borax mixture to the joint, and, as soon as
this melts, stop the flame and remove from the hearth.
If the flame is kept on too long after this, there is a
possibility of &#8220;soaking&#8221; all the brass out of the joint,
especially so if the joint is not a very good fit.</p>

<p>Some braziers use a blacklead mixture for protecting
thin tubes whilst brazing; but care must be taken
to keep it out of the actual joint, as brass will not
adhere to metal where this is present.</p>

<p>Cycle frame joints can be brazed on an ordinary
smith&#8217;s hearth, but it is rather risky, and requires more
skill than with a gas blowpipe. It also requires a good<span class="pagenum" id="Page105">[105]</span>
clear fire and a light blast. The job should be kept
well fed with borax to prevent the tubes scaling and
burning. The joint should be loaded from the inside
with about a thimbleful or less of crushed borax and
No. 3 spelter mixed in the proportion of about half of
each in bulk. The heaviest part of the lug should be
heated first, and the work must be turned frequently
in the fire so as to avoid burning the tube. If the joint
is fed from the outside with borax until the brass flows
round it, a sound joint is ensured. This applies to a
joint where the lug is fitted inside the tube. Where
the tube is fitted inside the lug, a little brass and borax
should be applied outside the joint just as the inside
charge has melted, which can be seen with some joints
by looking down the inside of the tube. When the
tube is closed both ends, such as the last joint of a
frame, the job is more difficult and requires careful
judgment and skill to ensure a sound joint.</p>

<h3>Brazing Cast-iron.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;Although it has been dogmatically
asserted both that cast-iron can and cannot
be brazed, it may be stated that the general results of
attempting this process are so indifferent as to warrant
the conclusion that this process cannot be recommended.
In brazing, one of the conditions essential
to success is that the metal to be brazed and the spelter
should unite to form an alloy just where the brazing
occurs, and that this should take place spontaneously.
This actually happens when brazing copper, brass,
wrought-iron, etc., but not in the case of cast-iron.
If, however, the reader desires to experiment in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page106">[106]</span>
direction, the following hints may be useful. First of
all, remove all dirt and grease from the cast-iron, and
then chemically clean it by immersion in hydrochloric
acid, afterwards well rinsing it in clean cold water. A
mixture of borax and water and spelter should now be
applied where the brazing is required, and gentle heat
then brought to bear on it until the water is evaporated.
The heat should now be increased until the casting is
red hot in the neighbourhood of the brazing; and some
workers claim that at this juncture the best results are
obtained by dusting the red hot cast-iron liberally with
boric or boracic acid powder. A hard spelter should
be used in preference to a readily fusible one, otherwise
the spelter would be fused much too soon, and
before the casting is raised to a sufficiently high
temperature.</p>

<p>An experienced worker who believes that it is
possible to make a sound joint in cast-iron by brazing,
states that he has brazed articles with equal parts of
borax and boracic acid. The chief difficulty is the flux.
He has tried one called &#8220;Ferroment,&#8221; which seems to
give good results. The first casting brazed with it was
3 in. wide and <sup>5</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> in. thick, and this casting at the time
of writing had been in work six months for fifteen
hours per day. This same worker prefers to roast
borax before use, as it stops on the work better. Also,
when a deep, wide joint is being dealt with, he finds it
an advantage to smear on a little clay underneath and
the side, as should the joint get slightly hotter in one
part the spelter will run through and make an unsound<span class="pagenum" id="Page107">[107]</span>
joint. The heat required to braze cast-iron varies
somewhat with the spelter used. If brazing by means
of a smithy fire, the spelter will show a blue flame
when it starts to run, and the article must then be
removed from the fire. In using a blowpipe or blowlamp,
the blue flame does not show, and one has to
look for the spelter melting, and see that it flows well
along the joint before removing the flame. Spelter
which has been kept in stock a good time may not flow
well. The worker in question prefers brazing wire to
grain spelter, as by means of warming the end of the
wire and dipping in the flux (which will adhere to the
hot wire), it may be put just where desired. He
collects all the soft brass turnings from his lathe and
uses them for brazing.</p>

<p>Another worker has stated that those who have a
forge of any kind will find the following an effective
method of repairing an iron casting. A flux may be
made of chlorate of potash 4 oz., boracic acid 1 lb.,
and carbonate of iron 3 oz. These should be mixed
well together and pounded. The parts to be brazed
together should be carefully cleaned by scraping them,
and brought to a bright-red heat. Then apply the flux
and spelter and increase the heat.</p>

<p>Still another worker says that in brazing cast-iron,
if powdered soda is used instead of borax, the result
will be a perfect joint.</p>

<h2><span class="chapno">CHAPTER XI</span><br />
<span class="chaptitle">Welding Iron and Steel under the Hammer</span></h2>

<p>Iron and steel can be joined by heating until they become
plastic and then consolidating the two members
of the joint by hammer blows, the work being supported
on an anvil. Correct heat and cleanliness are
the chief requisites. The &#8220;welding heat&#8221; corresponds
with that temperature at which the metal is in a state
of partial fusion on the surface. The better the quality
of the iron, the higher the temperature it can stand
without being burned and ruined. Iron at a welding
heat gives off dazzling sparks, whereas ordinary cast
steel is only an intense yellow, but few sparks being
evolved. Sufficient lap for the proper making of the
joint must always be allowed. When heated in a perfectly
clear fire, the metal may need no treatment
prior to hammering; but otherwise it may be necessary
to sprinkle sand or some special flux over the work. At
the proper moment the iron is transferred to the anvil,
and the union of the two members of the joint immediately
effected; delay means an imperfect joint. In
lifting the work out of the fire, remove it vertically
and so as not to collect particles of dirt on it. Keep
a switch of brushwood at hand for removing adhering
matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page109">[109]</span></p>

<h3>Welding of Steel Specially Considered.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;Some
steels will &#8220;stand the fire&#8221; better than others,
which means that they will stand more heat before
they reach the point when they begin to burn.</p>

<p>The different kinds of steel used in a general way
may be summed up as blister, spring, shear, double
shear, and cast steel. Blister steel will, as a rule, stand
the most heating before beginning to burn, and the
others follow in the order given. The difference in
heating will vary from nearly a white heat on blister
to the yellow heat of cast steel.</p>

<p>A simple method of ascertaining what heat a steel
will stand before beginning to burn is as follows: Heat
the steel to its burning point, and at various stages,
beginning at the yellow stage, lay it on the anvil and
give it a few blows with the hand hammer. Repeat
the process until a heat is reached that will cause the
steel, when struck with the hammer, to give off sparks
like small fireworks. When this stage is reached it
will show that the burning point is arrived at.</p>

<p>Careful observations of these points will enable the
smith to know just when to begin to use the flux for
welding, which, by the way, must be just before the
steel reaches the burning point.</p>

<p>Another important point is the formation of the
scarfs. These should not be fullered down so thin or
left in the same form as the scarfs as when joining iron,
and should be shorter (compare <span class="smcapall">A</span> and <span class="smcapall">B</span>, <a href="#Fig66">Fig. 66</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig66">
<img src="images/illo111.png" alt="" width="600" height="118" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 66.&mdash;Scarfs for Iron and Steel</p>
</div>

<p>In bringing the steel up to its welding point, care
must be taken to have it at a uniform heat throughout<span class="pagenum" id="Page110">[110]</span>
at the part for welding; and, to get this, the blast
should not be forced at the start, but used gently. In
some cases the blast should be stopped occasionally,
to allow the steel to soak. Then restart the blast, and
gradually force it when beginning to use the flux, continuing
so until the welding point is reached. Only
light blows should be given at the start, just to cause
the two parts to stick together; but when stuck, the
harder the blow the better the weld.</p>

<p>An idea seems prevalent that the flux has a certain
influence on the steel, and converts it into a form that
makes it more weldable. The real use of a flux in this
case is simply to retard the heat, and form a coat or
shell on the steel, and so counteract and prevent the
burning action which takes place when heating steel
in an ordinary blast fire.</p>

<p>The reason why different fluxes are required for
different brands of steel is no doubt due to the differences
in manufacture. As a rule, the greater the heat
the steel will stand before burning, the less it requires
a flux to protect it, so that in a great many cases a
flux consisting of some clean, sharp sand is all that is
required; but the steels that will burn at a lower heat
require something more than sand to protect them.
Hence arises the necessity of adding burnt borax,
crushed glass, powdered marble, etc.</p>

<p>The method of welding steel is as follows; but
before proceeding to get the heat make a point of
having a shallow tin on the forge large enough to hold
a sufficient quantity of the flux, so that it will cover<span class="pagenum" id="Page111">[111]</span>
the scarfed end when being dipped in same. Have
a clean fire and plenty of firing on the hearth, so that
the heat can be well covered. Start with gentle blast
until the heat is nearly up to burning point. If necessary,
stop the blast and let the heat soak for a few
seconds so as to ensure a uniform heat. Gradually
force the blast, and keep withdrawing the &#8220;heats&#8221; and
roll them well in the flux, and so continue until it is
thought that the heat is plastic enough to unite. Place
the scarfs in position, give a few light blows until the
parts stick together, then hammer well home and move
smartly so as to ensure the proper joining together
whilst in a plastic state. When welded, do not continue
the hammering or tooling at too low a heat; but
if further hammering is necessary, re-heat the work.</p>

<p>These hints are not applicable to every make of
steel. With the special steels manufacturers issue particular
instructions.</p>

<p>A flux for welding cast steel consists of 2 oz. each
of powdered chalk, soda and burnt borax, mixed with
1 lb. of silver sand.</p>

<p>A firm of steel manufacturers recommend a mixture
of 21 oz. of sand and 7 oz. of salt, moistened; the
steel is to be treated in a fire of sulphurless coal.</p>

<p>The air is conveyed through an 8-in. brass tube <span class="smcapall">J</span>
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in. in diameter, which should be smooth inside. This
latter point is of some importance, and, if preferred,
a glass tube may be used instead of brass, the current
of cold air having a sufficient cooling effect to prevent<span class="pagenum" id="Page113">[113]</span>
undue heating. The end should be cut off sharp with
a file in the ordinary way and left in that condition.
Smoothing the edge by fusion in a flame will not improve
matters, but rather the reverse. Of course, the
other end, which comes outside, must be smoothed to
prevent injury to the indiarubber tube used for making
connection with the bellows. The air tube must be
held firmly in the centre of the gas tube, while capable
of being moved in or out for the purpose of adjusting
the flame. This can be done quite satisfactorily by
means of a short brass tube or nipple <span class="smcapall">K</span>, threaded to
screw into the <span class="symbol">T</span> (<i>see</i> <a href="#Fig67">Fig. 67</a>). A sound cork should
be driven into this short tube so as to entirely fill it,
a hole being made with a cork-borer to admit the air
tube. This hole must be exactly central, and the cork
must grip rather tightly.</p>

<p>A foot-bellows is generally used for supplying the
air, the bellows being connected with the air jet <span class="smcapall">J</span> by
means of an indiarubber tube. The tube <span class="smcapall">D</span>, which
should extend an inch or so below the bench, is to be
connected with the gas supply.</p>

<h3>A Simple Gas Blowpipe.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;A simple form of gas
blowpipe is shown in <a href="#Fig68">Fig. 68</a>, the rubber tube connecting
it with the gas supply being fixed on the pipe
at the point of connection with the cock. To construct
the appliance, one end of a piece of brass gas pipe
of the required length with, say, a <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>-in. bore, is bent
as shown, whilst at the back of the curve thus made a
hole is drilled to admit a tube <span class="smcapall">A</span> <sup>5</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> in. in diameter.
This should have one end (<i>see</i> dotted lines) bent to<span class="pagenum" id="Page114">[114]</span>
correspond with the angle previously formed in the
larger tube, whilst its other extremity should be bent
upwards. Make these pipes red hot where they are to
be bent, and, if they are afterwards plunged in cold
water, the material will to some extent be softened,
and its tendency to split will be obviated. The smaller
tube is passed through the hole in the bend of the
larger one, the ends being almost flush and quite concentric.
Solder the parallel portions of the tubes together,
and then fix a gas-regulating cock to the larger
one, as in <a href="#Fig68">Fig. 68</a>. The end is then connected to an
ordinary bracket or burner by means of an indiarubber
tube <span class="smcapall">G</span>, and a short piece of tubing is fitted with a bone
or other mouthpiece, and attached to the projecting end
of the air tube. This instrument will do any soldering,
and will be suitable for melting gold, silver, and brass,
or brazing odd jobs in iron or steel. Of course, when
used for the last-named purpose it would be in conjunction
with asbestos tubes or other supports.</p>

<h3>Proportion of Air to Gas.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;As regards the relative
volumes of gas and air for blowpipes, the late Mr.
Thomas Fletcher said that, speaking roughly, but still
sufficiently near to make a correct rule by which to
work, a blowpipe requires one volume of gas to eight
of air. If the gas is supplied at a pressure equal to
1 in. of water, and the air at eight times that pressure,
then, to get the best effect, the area of the gas and air
pipes should be equal. If the air supply is equal to
16 in. of water pressure, the gas pipe must be double
the area of the air, and so on in proportion. Some<span class="pagenum" id="Page116">[116]</span>
makers assert that a better working flame is produced
by using ten volumes of air to one volume of gas; but,
of course, if the blowpipe is fitted with taps, the supplies
can be adjusted easily. It will be found, however,
that any practical departure from Fletcher&#8217;s rule will
result in a loss of power.</p>

<h3>Capacities of Blowpipes.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;It has been said, a blowpipe
with a <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>-in. air jet, if worked with an air pressure
of 10 oz. per square inch&mdash;that is, 15 in. of water&mdash;will
braze up to about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> lb. total weight; or in other
words, will securely unite two pieces of brass each
weighing <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> lb. With the same pressure a <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>-in. bore
air-jet will braze a total weight of about 2 lb., and so
on in proportion. It will be understood that the air
jet is measured at the point at which the blast leaves
the air tube, whilst the area of the gas supply is that
of the annular space between the two tubes. When
the air tube is thus carried inside the gas tube (<i>see</i>
<a href="#Fig69">Fig. 69</a>), the tool appears to be much larger than it
really is, and this accounts for the fact that a <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>-in.
size blowpipe with the air tube fixed outside the gas
supply is just as effective as one of the <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>-in. size which
carry the air tube inside the stem. All indiarubber
tubing must be perfectly smooth inside, for if it is
wired or in any way rough, the resultant friction will
cause a loss of pressure. It should also be of as large
a bore as is convenient.</p>

<h3>Large and Efficient Blowpipe.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;A large and efficient
blowpipe that can be made in a few minutes is
shown by <a href="#Fig69">Fig. 69</a>, the only materials required being<span class="pagenum" id="Page117">[117]</span>
a <span class="symbol">T</span>-coupling and diminishing socket, an elbow, and
one or two pieces of pipe. The air tube <span class="smcapall">A</span> (represented
for the most part by dotted lines) passes through the
diminishing socket until it almost reaches the nozzle
of the blowpipe, with which it is concentric. By using
the elbow <span class="smcapall">D</span>, the two supply pipes are brought parallel
to each other, so that the indiarubber connecting tubes
can be more easily held in the hand like reins, as by
simply squeezing them the flame can be readily regulated.
Sometimes, in cases of emergency, a plug
drilled to meet the air tube is used in place of the
socket. The plug is thrust into the end of the <span class="symbol">T</span>-socket;
but in all cases it must be airtight. This blowpipe can
be used efficiently only in conjunction with a foot
blower.</p>

<h2><span class="chapno">CHAPTER XIII</span><br />
<span class="chaptitle">Managing Blow-lamps</span></h2>

<p>The stoves and lamps burning paraffin in the form of
vapour have become very popular on account of their
good heating properties, portability, and little attention
required. They consist of a container holding paraffin,
a burner with a heating tube attached is screwed to
the container, and a tube leading almost to the bottom.
A small air-tube, similar to a cycle-pump, is fixed in
container, the handle and cap only being in sight.
When the burner tubes are heated, a thumbscrew on
the filler caps is closed, and a few strokes of the pump
puts a slight pressure on the oil in the container. The
oil is forced up the central tube to the burner; but
before reaching this it has to flow round the heating
coils, and in so doing is turned to vapour. The outlet
at the nipple being very small, causes the vapour to
issue with some force, and it mixes with the air, forming
a mixture which burns with a non-luminous flame
similar to that of a bunsen burner. This flame plays
on the heating coils, and once started, the lamp is
practically automatic; a stroke or two from the pump
will keep it going until the oil is consumed.</p>

<p>There are patterns that use petrol or benzol, their
action being slightly different. Petrol and benzol are
light spirits, which give off inflammable vapour at a<span class="pagenum" id="Page119">[119]</span>
much lower heat than paraffin does. Advantage is
taken of this fact by causing burner and nipple to be
in one solid brass casting, so that when the nozzle is
heated, the brass conducts the heat back to the nipple
and so vaporises the petrol, which is fed to the nipple
by a thick wick contained in a tube which reaches
almost to the bottom of the container, the wick touching
the bottom.</p>

<p>To start either paraffin or petrol lamps, the exit tube
or nozzle is heated. The petrol lamp has no coils round
the nozzle; but comes straight from the holder to the
exit nipple. The size of flame is regulated by a needle
valve fitted with a wood or fibre handle. The petrol
lamp has no pump, except on high-power brazing
lamps whose use requires expert handling.</p>

<p>The chief trouble with lamps using paraffin is that
the burner becomes choked; this is shown by the lamp
jumping out or the flame not attaining sufficient heat.
The makers supply a proper cleaning needle, a sheet
stamped to form a handle and a piece of fine steel wire
fixed at one end. Nothing else, such as pins, etc.,
should be used, or the hole in the nipple becomes enlarged,
and emitting too much gas, causes a smoky
flame. The cleaner should be used each time before
lighting. A good way to avoid this trouble is to use
a small funnel with fine brass gauze soldered in the
body when filling. White Rose is a quite satisfactory
oil for these lamps.</p>

<p>After considerable use the heating coil becomes
choked with carbon deposit. A new heater tube can<span class="pagenum" id="Page120">[120]</span>
be obtained, or the old one cleaned by drilling two or
three holes in the ends and passing a piece of flexible
wire (such as Bowden brake wire) through the heater
and removing the obstruction. After getting it clean,
tap out the holes and fix suitable screws, flat under
the head, with a piece of asbestos to make a tight joint.</p>

<p>If a larger flame is not obtained by pumping, take
the cap off the pump and draw out the plunger; the
leather is probably worn. Fit a new one; or it may
have become hard, in which case apply a little oil and
open out carefully. The retaining valve is in the
centre of the pump bottom, and is removed by using
a long key down the pump barrel. The valve is in four
pieces. See that the spring is free and that the cork
is in good condition. When replacing, take care not
to get it cross thread, and screw firmly home. The
washer under the filler cap is of rubber and cuts
through in time. Do not use pliers to screw down; it
will go gas-tight with the fingers if the washer is good.</p>

<p>To remove the nipple from which the gas issues is
almost impossible without a proper key. This has a
universal joint, which allows it to be rotated, although
the handle is almost at right angles with the burner.
Keys and all other parts mentioned can be obtained
from any dealer in these lamps.</p>

<p>With the lamps using petrol, the only parts requiring
attention are the plate from which gas issues
and the wick. Unlike the paraffin nipple, this is a
circular stamping of brass approximately <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in. in
diameter with a fine hole in the centre. To remove<span class="pagenum" id="Page121">[121]</span>
this disc, pass a long flat screwdriver blade through
two openings in the nozzle and turn to the left (anti-clockwise),
holding the body of the lamp firmly on the
bench. Before fitting a new disc, thoroughly clean
recess and remove any deposit from the inside of the
valve box. Unscrew the needle and gland if there is
any leak there, and clean and repack with asbestos
yarn. A little glycerine on the packing appears to be
an advantage. Place the disc in position, dip an
asbestos washer in water, and screw the nozzle firmly
down.</p>

<p>The wick inside the lamp filters the spirit before
reaching the nipple and occasionally needs replacing.
Remove the cap from the bottom of the lamp, and with
a piece of thick wire flattened at one end and filed to
a hook, push it up the tube and withdraw the old wick.
The new one is simply put in its place and the cap
screwed tight. The washer under the filled cap is of
cork and rarely gives any trouble.</p>

<h2><span class="chapno">CHAPTER XIV</span><br />
<span class="chaptitle">Making Blow-lamps</span></h2>

<p><b>A Paraffin Brazing Blow-lamp.</b>&mdash;The brazing blowlamp
shown in <a href="#Fig70">Fig. 70</a> was made at a total cost of
less than 4s. The illustration is printed to a scale of
about one-quarter full size. The lamp illustrated is
not a mere experiment, as the writer of this description
had a similar one in use for over two years, and during
that time brazed hundreds of jobs with its aid.</p>

<p>The container is of tinplate, and adapted from a
workman&#8217;s tea can. When purchased this will have
a wire handle and two hinges, and these should be removed
and soldered up. The handle shown at <span class="smcapall">H</span> is made
from a strip of iron, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>-in. by <sup>5</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>-in. section, bent round
to the shape shown and riveted to the side of the container.
These rivets should be well soldered over inside
to prevent leakage. The joint of the longer strip
is shown at <span class="smcapall">X</span>. The lid should next be taken in hand,
a <sup>5</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub>-in. hole being drilled at one side close to the
handle, to take an ordinary Lucas cycle valve. A
leather washer is fitted inside, and also one outside
under the lock nut, the latter being then tightly
clamped up.</p>

<p>At <span class="smcapall">E</span> is shown the filling cap, the body part of which
was taken from an old paraffin oil-lamp container, and
the screw cap made at the local brass works; but this<span class="pagenum" id="Page123">[123]</span>
fitting can be obtained in a finished state from many
model-fittings manufacturers. This is soldered to the
lid in the position shown, a hole being afterwards
drilled in the tin to suit it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig70">
<img src="images/illo123.png" alt="" width="500" height="461" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 70.&mdash;Paraffin
Brazing Blow-lamp,
the container being
shown in section</p>
</div>

<p>The cock shown at <span class="smcapall">D</span> is an ordinary gas-cock, with
a length of <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>-in. outside-diameter copper piping screwed
and sweated in beneath. This is passed through a hole
drilled in the lid for its reception, and the base of the
cock is then sweated in position. Note that the length
of this pipe is such that when the lid is in place it
clears the container bottom by <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> in.</p>

<p>The coil of piping at <span class="smcapall">P</span> is <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>
in. diameter copper tube<span class="pagenum" id="Page124">[124]</span>
coiled round to the shape shown, the lower end being
tightly screwed into the top of the cock. The opposite
end is screwed for a short length of <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>-in. gas thread,
and very tightly fitted with a screw plug such as that
used by plumbers for shutting off a portion of gas
piping. Before screwing this on, a small hole about
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>32</sub> in. in diameter should be drilled in the middle of
same; this is the nipple for the exit of gas to the
burner.</p>

<p>The <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>-in. copper tubing should not require filling
with anything before bending; this operation is best
done round a mandrel of wood. No heating is necessary.
A certain amount of flattening of the tube will
no doubt occur, but this is immaterial. The end of the
flame tube is, of course, open, otherwise the flame could
not emerge. The nipple end of the flame tube is also
quite open, with the nipple end of the coil just projecting
inside. The portion of tubing shown dotted in
<a href="#Fig70">Fig. 70</a> takes the vapour from the coils to the nipple;
it does not pass through the coils, but at the back of
them, and bends round as shown.</p>

<p>The lid of the container should now be carefully
soldered down all round, and then the <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub>-in. brass stay
rod shown at <span class="smcapall">S</span> must be fitted and both ends sweated
over. It is essential that this stay is not omitted, as
otherwise the pressure to which the container is subjected
would bulge out the ends.</p>

<p>The flame tube <span class="smcapall">A</span> should now be made of <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>32</sub>-in.
sheet-iron, being held in place by two or three clips
riveted on and bent over the coil ends as shown at <span class="smcapall">C</span>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page125">[125]</span>
only one of which is shown for clearness. The flame
tube does not taper, nor is the back end closed up. Its
diameter should be 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in. and length 3<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in., but this
depends on the size of the hole in the nipple. No
holes are required in this tube, as all the air is drawn
in at the end. The nipple has a gas thread cut inside
it, and it is screwed tightly on to the end of the copper
coil. The length of the pipe from tap to coil is not
important; about 9 in. will be satisfactory.</p>

<p>The best means of joining the nipple to the tube
is to screw the end of the tube before bending it round
at the end, and then to screw the nipple on tightly.
The pipe can afterwards be bent as shown.</p>

<p>The jet hole in the nipple should be about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>32</sub> in.
bare, and should be so drilled that the issuing gas passes
through the centre of the flame tubes. The tube is
open at both ends, to allow air to be drawn down and
complete the combustion of the paraffin vapour, the
mixture igniting and burning properly when the
vapour passes out at the other end and comes into contact
with the atmosphere.</p>

<p>To use the lamp, it should be filled about two-thirds
or one-half full of paraffin oil, and the container cap
then screwed hard down with a leather cap as a washer.
A cycle pump should then be connected to the valve <span class="smcapall">V</span>,
and a few strokes given, the cock <span class="smcapall">D</span> being meanwhile
closed. The copper coil should next be put into a
gas flame or the fire for a few minutes until nearly red
hot, and then the cock <span class="smcapall">D</span> should be opened a shade,
which will allow the paraffin to rise up the pipe <span class="smcapall">I</span>
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page126">[126]</span>
enter the coils <span class="smcapall">P</span>, where it will become vaporised, and
the gas will then issue from the nozzle <span class="smcapall">N</span>, and burn at
the mouth of the coils.</p>

<p>The lamp may then be applied to the job, and five
or six more strokes given to the pump, when the
flame should burn with an intense heat and give out a
roaring noise.</p>

<p>The theory of action of lamps of this character is
as follows: The pressure of air in the container forces
the paraffin up the copper tube into the coil, where
it is vaporised by the red-hot piping. The vapour then
issues at some pressure from the nipple hole and, passing
down the flame tube, an ejector action is caused
which draws air in with it. This air mingles with the
paraffin vapour, and when the mixture issues at the
other end, and comes into contact with more air, combustion
takes place.</p>

<p>The heat produced by the lamp should be quite sufficient
to braze the bottom bracket of a motor-cycle
frame and other similar jobs. The size of nipple with
relation to the size of the flame tube is most important.
If the flame tube be too large in proportion, the result
is an excess of air, which cools the gas unduly and the
flame dies out. A candle is put out in a draught from
the same cause. On the other hand, if the flame tube
is too small, or the nipple hole too large, the result is
an excess of gas, causing incomplete combustion and a
partly luminous and smoky flame, with less heating
power. To ascertain if the nipple hole is too small,
take a strip of tin and, whilst the lamp is burning, hold<span class="pagenum" id="Page127">[127]</span>
the tin partly over the end of the flame tube, so as to
restrict the amount of air entering, and note the result.</p>

<p>If the drawing (<a href="#Fig70">Fig. 70</a>) be regarded as 4 in. to
1 ft., and the lamp made accordingly, it will be of
ample size to braze small and model boilers. It must
be understood, though, that the size of the lamp alone
does not govern the size of the flame, this depending
entirely on, firstly, the size of the nipple, and secondly,
the pressure of air in the container forcing the vapour
out. The larger the container, the longer the lamp
will burn without refilling, and, incidentally, the larger
it is the weaker the container will be, and vice versa.</p>

<p>Should this lamp be required for brazing and silver-soldering
articles about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. in diameter, it must be
altered, as it is obviously much too large. The same
container will do, of course, although perhaps rather
unwieldy. If preferred, another container just half the
size could be made; this will be handier in use, although
it will not allow the lamp to burn for so long a period
without recharging as the larger pattern. For the
tubing, <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub>-in. copper tube, preferably solid drawn, will
be suitable. This should be heated to a dull red and
then quenched in water to anneal it, this making the
task of bending it much simpler. If it kinks too much
in the bent portions, pour some molten resin into the
tube, one end being plugged up for this purpose, and
when set, bend to the shape desired. The resin can be
heated and run out afterwards. The flame tube may
be half the diameter and length of the one illustrated,
but no hard and fast rule can be given for the dimensions<span class="pagenum" id="Page128">[128]</span>
of this part of the lamp, as the size of the nipple
hole has everything to do with this. Make the latter
just big enough to admit a fine needle. A simple
method is to drill the cap almost through, and then
punch the rest through with the point of a needle. By
experimenting, it will be easy to find the right proportions
of flame tube and nipple hole. The screwed joints
should be a metal-to-metal fit as it is termed, that is,
they should fit so tightly when screwed home that no
leakage is possible. This can be ensured by seeing that
all male threads are a tight fit in their respective holes.</p>

<h2><span class="chapno">CHAPTER XV</span><br />
<span class="chaptitle">Electric and Thermit Welding Briefly Considered</span></h2>

<p><b>Contact Welding.</b>&mdash;The electric welding of iron
strips and sheets is usually done by the Thomson process
of &#8220;contact-welding.&#8221; In this process the metal
is brought to a welding heat by passing a very large
current through the joint to be welded, which, by
virtue of its high resistance in relation to other parts
of the circuit, develops great local heat. When the
correct temperature for welding is reached, the joint is
pressed together by mechanical means, and the current
interrupted. In <a href="#Fig71">Fig. 71</a> the necessary arrangements
for the welding of a steel rim are sketched. <span class="smcapall">A</span> is the
iron core of an alternating current transformer and <span class="smcapall">B</span>
the primary winding supplied with alternating current
either from a works dynamo or a public supply, and
controlled by a double-pole switch <span class="smcapall">C</span>. The transformer
has a secondary winding consisting of a single copper
strip of very heavy section <span class="smcapall">D</span>, in which secondary currents
of low voltage but very large volume are induced.
This winding <span class="smcapall">D</span> terminates in two heavy metal clamps
<span class="smcapall">E</span>, one fixed and the other capable of movement by
rack and pinion or screw, and the clamps must be
shaped to the contours of the work <span class="smcapall">F</span> they are intended
to hold, so as to fit well and present as little electrical
resistance there as possible. The butt ends of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page130">[130]</span>
wheel rim are brought into contact, current switched
on at the transformer primary, and immediately a very
heavy secondary current passes round the &#8220;winding&#8221;
<span class="smcapall">D</span>, generating intense heat at the junction of the metal
rim <span class="smcapall">G</span> held in the clamps, where the electrical resistance
is comparatively high. In a few moments the
joint will arrive at welding heat and the screw feed is
then operated, driving the joint together and completing
the weld, except so far as a little hand dressing may
be found necessary. Directly the weld is established
the current is switched off at the mains and the job
allowed to cool out. Nothing less than 5 kilowatts to
10 kilowatts is likely to be very satisfactory for hoops
about <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in. by No. 16 gauge, and the current must be
alternating. The primary voltage and frequency is
immaterial, as the transformer can be wound to suit
the circuit conditions whatever they may be.</p>

</div>

<p>The method of welding by resistance, that is, by
raising locally the welding point to the temperature
required by bringing the two surfaces into contact until
their high resistance produces a welding heat and then
squeezing them together, is by far the most manageable
and satisfactory commercial process of the two
electrical processes. It is adapted for &#8220;spot-welding&#8221;
or producing local adhesions between metal plates after
the manner of riveting, for butt or end-on welds, for
seams, chains, rings, etc., and automatic welding
machines are now made that can deal with no less than
1,500 welds and upwards per hour with semi-skilled
labour, with the least possible percentage of failures<span class="pagenum" id="Page131">[131]</span>
and a very low cost for electrical energy. Alternating
current is essential with this type of weld, and is used
to energise a step-down transformer of special construction.</p>

<h3>Arc Welding.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;Notwithstanding the superiority of
the resistance welding process to most commercial
work, particularly that of a small
kind necessitating rapid repeat
work, the &#8220;arc&#8221; method, which
has been in use for many years,
and was probably the first experimented
with, has now become
largely used on work where it was
thought impossible to adapt it a
few years ago. The system is
extensively employed in iron and
steel works, shipyards, and boiler
works, and the class of work it is
employed on varies from the dismantling
of iron and steel buildings,
by fusing and cutting
through the structural ironwork
and girders, to the filling up of blowholes in castings.
The metal to be welded is connected to one pole, and
the electrode handled by the operator forms the other
pole, an arc being struck between the two. Broken
castings and forgings can be satisfactorily repaired by
running new fused metal round them.</p>

<p>Recently the arc system has been applied with success
for making welds on tramway rails, the resistance<span class="pagenum" id="Page132">[132]</span>
of the welded joint being found very much lower than
when made with the usual fishplates and bonded joints.
Continuous current gives better results than alternating
for the arc system, and a generator designed for use with
this process has a &#8220;drooping characteristic,&#8221; that is,
the volts at the terminals fall rapidly with an increase
in the current output. In this way the current is automatically
limited to some extent, when the short-circuiting
effect of the operation comes into play. Successfully
to weld by this process a current of 300 to 500
amperes at 80 volts is necessary, and every precaution
has to be taken to protect the workman from the intense
glare of the arc.</p>


<p id="Ref01"><b>Thermit.</b>&mdash;Thermit is an aluminium alloy whose
combustion generates so much heat that the substance
can be used for the welding of iron and steel. It is
the patented invention of Dr. Hans Goldschmidt. With
thermit as a means of melting and welding, and with
the use of special clamps and devices, a number of
operations, otherwise difficult, can be performed, and
thermit has come into general use for repairing broken
or defective parts. By the use of a portable jacket and
clamp, the joints of gas, water, and steam pipes may
be welded with the pipes in position; and the advantages
of such a material to an engineer far removed
from supplies and repair shop, as at sea, can hardly
be enumerated. New journals have been welded to
heavy rolls, broken pump-rods have been joined, and
a number of structural parts successfully united by
its aid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page133">[133]</span></p>

<p>Thermit is made up as follows: Iron oxide is intimately
mixed up with about one-third as much in
weight of powdered aluminium, according to the equation
Fe<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;O<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;2&nbsp;Al = Al<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;O<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;2&nbsp;Fe. The metals to be
united are placed together and surrounded by a little
clay or similar substance and the mixture is placed all
around the joint. The mixture is fired by a little
magnesium, and the chemical change that follows
creates such an intense heat that iron is readily welded.
When the joint is cold and cleaned up it is hardly
perceptible.</p>

<p>According to instructions published by Thermit,
Ltd., it is of the utmost importance that the moulds,
crucibles, etc., should be kept thoroughly dry, and they
may advantageously be warmed before use to ensure
the absence of any dampness. The parts to be welded
must previously be brought to red heat, which is best
effected by means of a gas and air flame. The proper
design of the mould is of the utmost importance. It
should have a runner and riser, and the metal should
be allowed to flow between as well as around the ends
of the pieces to be welded. The expense and inconvenience
of making wooden patterns may be obviated
by making the model of wax, ramming the sand round
this, and subsequently melting out the wax.</p>

<h2><span class="chapno">CHAPTER XVI</span><br />
<span class="chaptitle">Oxy-Acetylene Welding</span></h2>

<p>Of late years oxy-acetylene welding and cutting have
made great strides, and have placed at the disposal of
the metal-working trades a means of doing many things
that hitherto were impossible. Purified acetylene and
oxygen, both under pressure, are supplied to a special
blowpipe or torch. The flame in its hottest part has
a temperature of about 4,000&deg; C. and is therefore sufficiently
high to melt any metals with which it may be
brought into contact. The torch is fitted with all
necessary adjustments to vary the supply of either of
the gases, and constitutes a handy tool with which the
intelligent worker soon acquires great dexterity. In
a special form of the torch there is a means of introducing
a further supply of compressed oxygen, which
makes it possible for the blowpipe flame to cut its
way rapidly through thick metal, the particles of which
are actually consumed in the path of the oxygen.</p>

<p>It is out of the question in a single chapter of a
handbook covering such a large scope as the present
work to do more than indicate some of the uses to
which the oxy-acetylene torch or blowpipe may be put.
This chapter is obviously no attempt whatever at providing
a complete working guide to oxy-acetylene welding.
All that will be here attempted is to present a<span class="pagenum" id="Page135">[135]</span>
brief description of a typical outfit and some notes on
working the blowpipe, and then to give some practical
instruction from the pen of an oxy-acetylene welder on
the treatment of copper, aluminium and cast-iron. It
may here be pointed out that there is now a large
number of firms specialising in the manufacture of oxy-acetylene
welders&#8217; appliances, and most of them publish
illustrated catalogues which anyone proposing to
equip himself for oxy-acetylene welding would do well
to obtain.</p>

<p>The source of the oxygen used in welding is now
always cylinders, which are obtainable in various sizes,
either by purchase or on hire from the gas-compressing
companies, to whom they have to be returned for recharging.
The acetylene also can be had in the compressed
form, but in this case the gas is not simply
compressed into steel cylinders because, if it were, any
simple shock would be likely to cause explosion. The
acetylene is therefore dissolved in liquid acetone, the
cylinders containing some porous substance such as
fossil meal, which is saturated with the acetone and
the acetylene then pumped in. These also can be
bought or hired from the gas-compressing companies.
A tremendous amount of welding is done, however,
with acetylene generated on the spot, and there are on
the market quite a number of approved appliances that
can be recommended, the best form of generator being
that in which the calcium carbide is dropped into the
water instead of the water dripping into the charge
of calcium carbide. It is essential that the gas be<span class="pagenum" id="Page136">[136]</span>
purified before use. As most people doubtless know,
acetylene is one of the hydro-carbon series of gases and
is evolved by the action of water on calcium carbide,
a substance which is one of the products of the electric
furnace.</p>

<p>The particulars and instructions on <a href="#Page136">pp. 136</a> to <a href="#Page139">139</a>
are due to the Acetylene Corporation, Ltd. <a href="#Fig72">Fig. 72</a>
presents a diagrammatic illustration of a complete oxy-acetylene
blowpipe equipment with the exception of the
acetylene generator and holder, which apparatus may
be placed in any suitable position (preferably outside)
at any reasonable distance from the blowpipe. <span class="smcapall">A</span> is
an ordinary gas tap connecting the hydraulic back pressure
valve <span class="smcapall">B</span> with the acetylene supply pipe from the
acetylene holder. The blowpipe is connected at valve
<span class="smcapall">C</span> by means of a flexible tube with the outlet tap <span class="smcapall">D</span>
of the hydraulic back-pressure valve. This forms the
acetylene supply pipe to the blowpipe. The blowpipe
is connected at valve <span class="smcapall">E</span> by means of a special canvas-covered
strong rubber pipe with the outlet tap <span class="smcapall">F</span> of the
oxygen pressure regulator, which is fixed, as shown,
on the oxygen cylinder. <span class="smcapall">G</span> is a pressure gauge. This
pipe conveys the oxygen supply to the blowpipe, and
should be securely attached, as it is subject to pressures
varying from 5 lb. to 40 lb. per sq. in. The hydraulic
back-pressure valve should have been previously
charged with water, and the gas regulator screwed into
the oxygen cylinder. The blowpipe apparatus is now
ready for use, with the taps <span class="smcapall">A</span> and <span class="smcapall">D</span> closed and the taps
<span class="smcapall">C</span>, <span class="smcapall">E</span> and <span class="smcapall">F</span> open.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page137">[137]</span></p>

<p>First, slowly open the oxygen cylinder valve (not
shown) with the key supplied for that purpose. By
means of the thumb-screw <span class="smcapall">H</span>, adjust the gas pressure
to the correct working pressure for the blowpipe used.
The approximate pressure
of oxygen required
for each blowpipe is as
follows: No. 2, 8 lb.
per sq. in.; No. 3, 10
lb.; No. 4, 11 lb.; No.
5, 12 lb.; No. 6, 14 lb.;
No. 7, 16 lb.; No. 8,
19 lb.; No. 10, 20 lb.;
No. 12, 25 lb.; No. 15,
30 lb. Then open the
acetylene taps <span class="smcapall">A</span> and <span class="smcapall">D</span>,
and when acetylene is
unmistakably smelt at
the nozzle of the blowpipe,
ignite the gases by
means of a gas jet,
candle, or taper. Then
by means of the tap <span class="smcapall">C</span>
slowly throttle down the
acetylene until the small
white cone of flame at
the nozzle of the blowpipe shows a clearly defined outline.
As some indication of the correct size of the
cone, it may be mentioned that when working with the
No. 10 blowpipe this should be about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in. diameter by<span class="pagenum" id="Page138">[138]</span>
<sup>5</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> in. long. This cone in the other blowpipes is
greater or less according to the relative size.</p>

<p>The tap <span class="smcapall">A</span> must never be used to regulate the supply
of acetylene; in fact, after the hydraulic back-pressure
valve has been charged with water, it is best to leave
this tap always on.</p>

<p>The working pressure for oxygen previously given
should not be too rigidly adhered to. Even in the same
sizes of blowpipes the conditions must vary slightly,
and a little practical experience with each blowpipe
will soon indicate the best working conditions. If the
flame is not properly regulated it may fire back and go
out. If so, the taps <span class="smcapall">C</span> and <span class="smcapall">E</span> should be shut off at
once, and a few seconds allowed to elapse before relighting.
When work is carried on for a long time at
a stretch and the burner becomes warm, it will be
found necessary to slightly open the acetylene tap <span class="smcapall">C</span>
from time to time. If work is being done which involves
the nozzle of the blowpipe being held in a confined
space, it is advantageous to cool this end of the
blowpipe by immersing it from time to time in a bucket
of water. While this is done the gases must be turned
off at <span class="smcapall">C</span> and <span class="smcapall">E</span>.</p>

<p>Welding should be done at the apex or outer extremity
of the small white cone.</p>

<p>If the hole in the nozzle of the blowpipe gets
obstructed at any time through beads of iron being
splashed into it, or from any other cause, it may be
cleared with a piece of copper wire and cleaned with a
wire brush. No steel reamer or other sharp instrument<span class="pagenum" id="Page139">[139]</span>
should be used in the hole, which otherwise will be
altered in size.</p>

<p>On stopping work the acetylene tap <span class="smcapall">C</span> should be
closed first and then the oxygen tap <span class="smcapall">E</span>. When work is
completely stopped, the oxygen cylinder should be shut
off. The oxygen cylinder valve should never be opened
until taps <span class="smcapall">F</span> and <span class="smcapall">E</span> are open, and it should then be
opened slowly. In this way sudden impact of oxygen
in the regulator is obviated.</p>

<p>The following instructions on the methods of welding
copper, cast-iron and aluminium are contributed by
a foreman welder.</p>

<h3>Welding Copper.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;Copper to be welded should have
its edges bevelled to enable the welding to penetrate
the entire thickness of the metal. Bevelling is not
generally practised below a thickness of <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>32</sub> in. From
<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>32</sub> in. to <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub>
in., a slight open bevel is sufficient; <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> in.
thick and over, the angle of the bevel should be about
90&deg;. It is not necessary to go beyond this even with
great thickness. The bevelling should be regular,
especially at the bottom, so as not to produce holes or
excess of thickness at the bottom of the bevel.</p>

<p>The edges to be welded and their immediate neighbourhood
should be thoroughly cleaned. This can be
done with a file, scraper, or sheets of emery. Chemical
agents such as spirits of salt or nitric acid are sometimes
employed; but it is preferable to precede their
use by a mechanical cleaning.</p>

<p>Before beginning the welding the parts should be
carefully arranged so that during the welding operation<span class="pagenum" id="Page140">[140]</span>
they remain perfectly in position. Owing to the high
conductivity of copper, a relatively larger blowpipe tip
must be used than when welding either iron or mild
steel of the same thickness. The power of a blowpipe
of 225 litres with an approximate consumption of 7&middot;75
cub. ft. of acetylene per hour would be suitable, with
economical results, for iron or mild steel <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> in. thick,
whereas for copper of the same thickness the power of
the blowpipe should be of 300 litres, having an approximate
consumption of 10&middot;5 cub. ft. of acetylene per
hour. Also, a blowpipe which is too strong tends to
melt the metal too rapidly. This should be as carefully
avoided as that of melting too slowly.</p>

<p>A pure copper welding rod may be employed for
filling in, but it is not so effective as a welding rod
made of phosphor copper. The phosphorus is incorporated
in a very small quantity, so that none remains
in the weld after its execution. A filler rod which
contains too much phosphorus lacks fluidity, and melts
at a temperature much lower than that of the copper
to be welded, thus facilitating adhesion. Moreover, the
welds in which the phosphorus remains lack elongation,
and therefore do not possess the same mechanical properties
as pure copper. The welding rod after <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> in.
of its diameter should be about equal to the thickness
of the weld, although in practice feeders about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in.
in diameter are not generally employed. Welds made
on copper without a deoxidising welding rod properly
prepared have a tendency to oxidise, and therefore do
not possess the required qualities. In addition, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page141">[141]</span>
surface of the metal must be covered with a carefully
prepared mixture of potassium phosphate and potassium
carbonate to a depth of about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> in. Upon the
application of the flame, the mixture will melt and
form a glaze over the surface of the copper, thus preventing
oxidation and assuring good work.</p>

<p>A flux consisting of chloride of sodium, sodium
borate, and boracic acid is also recommended. The
flux should be sparingly applied by dipping the end of
the welding rod into the vessel containing the flux.
The end of the rod should be warmed in order that the
flux adheres.</p>

<p>Before beginning the actual operation of welding,
it is essential to raise the edges of the weld and the
parts in the vicinity to a high temperature. The high
conductivity of the metal necessitates this, as any
supply of molten welding rod before the edges are in a
molten state inevitably produces adhesion. The flame
of the blowpipe should be perfectly regulated and maintained
without excess of either acetylene or oxygen.
In executing the weld, care must be taken to avoid
contact of the white jet of the blowpipe flame with the
metal just about to be melted. The distance of the
white jet should vary according to the power of the
blowpipe, say from <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> in. to <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> in. If this distance is
increased, the gases resulting from the second phase
of combustion, carbonic acid and water vapour, influence
the weld. Care must be taken that the fusion
of the metal should not be undertaken until the edges
of the weld and the parts near have been raised to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page142">[142]</span>
high temperature. At this moment the welding rod
and the parts to be joined should be melted simultaneously.
It is essential that the welding rod should
be regularly incorporated in the line of welding, and
must not be allowed to fall in drops. The operation
should be continuous, taking care to attack regularly
the two edges of the metal. The welding is thus
executed rapidly.</p>

<p>It is well known that internal strains are always
set up in every process of welding, due to the expansion
and contraction when a metal is heated and
cooled. Copper lacks tenacity when heated; hence
contraction of the metal, whose coefficient of expansion
is also fairly high; fractures thereby are often produced,
especially in the welded part. However, pre-heating
the article to a high temperature, maintaining
the heating after the operation of welding and slow
cooling, enables one in many cases to avoid fractures
due to contraction. It is also necessary to hammer the
line of welding and its vicinity. After the hammering
operation it is essential to reheat the copper, raising it
to redness (500&deg; C. to 600&deg; C.). Then plunge into cold
water, or cool as rapidly as possible. The structure
of the weld is not quite as homogeneous as other parts
of the piece welded. This is, however, controlled
largely by the skill and workmanship of the operator,
who can, at will, make the weld more or less homogeneous.</p>

<p>It is impossible to enumerate in anything like detail
all the work in copper which may be executed by<span class="pagenum" id="Page143">[143]</span>
oxy-acetylene autogenous welding. However, copper-smiths
are advantageously making great use of the
system, thereby replacing their old methods of brazing
and riveting.</p>

<h3>Welding Aluminium.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;In preparing aluminium to
be welded, the edges must first be thoroughly cleaned
and the welding rod very pure, so as to avoid the
incorporation of impurities, which is apt to bring
about rapid disintegration in the line of welding.
Bevelling the edges to be joined is not necessary below
a thickness of <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> in. From <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>
in. to <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> in. a slight open
bevel is sufficient, <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> in. thick and above angle of
bevel should be about 90&deg;. For thin sheets up to a
maximum of <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>32</sub> in., welding is facilitated by flanging
the edges at right angles. The depth of the flange
should be slightly deeper than the thickness of the
metal. By this method no welding rod is required, the
edges being simply fused. The weld should afterwards
be hammered level.</p>

<p>Aluminium should never be welded without a flux.
If welding is attempted without a flux, globules consisting
of aluminium within and a coating of alumina
(oxide of aluminium) will appear. In order to eliminate
these by the blowpipe flame it would be necessary to
raise the temperature to the melting point of the oxide
of aluminium, which is nearly 3,000&deg; C., whilst the
melting point of metallic aluminium is only 657&deg; C.
To produce a flux which will dissolve the oxide at the
low melting point of the metal and at the same time
protect the hot metal from contact with the air has<span class="pagenum" id="Page144">[144]</span>
obviously not been a simple problem to the chemist and
engineer. However, several good fluxes are now obtainable
which enable any experienced welder to effect
satisfactory welds in aluminium.</p>

<p>A flux consisting of the following ingredients can
be recommended: sodium chloride 30 parts, potassium
chloride 45 parts, lithium chloride 15 parts, potassium
fluoride 7 parts, and bisulphate of potassium 3 parts.</p>

<p>When making fluxes for the welding of aluminium,
great care is necessary in order to completely dry the
ingredients, thus avoiding their combination with each
other. On aluminium above <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>32</sub> in. thick, the flux is
best applied by dipping the end of the welding rod into
the vessel containing the flux. The end of the rod
should be first warmed in order that the flux adheres.
The welding rod after <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> in., its diameter should
be just about equal to the thickness of the weld,
although in practice feeders above <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in. diameter are
not advisable.</p>

<p>In executing the weld, care must be taken to avoid
contact of the white jet of the blowpipe flame with the
metal just about to be melted, because the high temperature
of this part tends to produce holes which are
difficult to fill in. The distance of the white jet should
vary according to the power of the blowpipe, say from
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in. to <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in. The flame should be so adjusted as to
furnish an excess of acetylene. There need be but little
fear of carbonising the metal, for the reason that the
temperature of the work is comparatively low. For
thin welds, up to <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> in. thick, it is preferable to hold<span class="pagenum" id="Page145">[145]</span>
the welding rod in front of the blowpipe in the direction
of the edges to be welded. As soon as the latter begins
to melt it is heated rapidly, and should be lowered to
form one molten bath with the metal of the piece. The
welding is thus done very rapidly. For great thicknesses
it is preferable to obtain fusion of the welding
rod, previously heated in the molten bath of the bevel.
Directly after welding, the weld should be thoroughly
washed in clean warm water in order to remove all
remaining traces of the flux, which would otherwise
continue to have a chemical action on the metal, thereby
setting up corrosion.</p>

<h3>Welding Cast-Iron.</h3><p class="noindent">&mdash;The edges of the weld should
be bevelled when the thickness exceeds <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> in.; this
enables the welding to penetrate the entire thickness
of the metal. Both edges must be bevelled to an
angle of 45&deg;, so as to form a right angle at the weld.
The bevelling should be regular, especially at the
bottom, so as not to produce holes or excess thickness
at the bottom of the bevel. Workers who attempt to
effect welds on cast-iron above, say, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in. in thickness,
without bevelling, invariably obtain poor results, as it
is impossible to get regular and thorough penetration.
The bevelling of the edges may be done by chipping
or grinding, etc. Grinding wheels made from a carbide
of silicon abrasive are very effective for cast-iron. The
edges to be welded and their immediate neighbourhood
must be free from sand, dirt, and rust.</p>

<p>It is known that internal strains are always set up
in every process of welding, due to the expansion and<span class="pagenum" id="Page146">[146]</span>
contraction when a metal body is heated and cooled.
These strains are not unavoidable, but their effect may
be minimised or nullified. In the case of cast-iron,
the tendency to crack will be greatly increased if the
cooling of the metal after fusion is rapid or irregular.
Consequently, the article to be welded should be pre-heated
slowly to about 700&deg; F. to 1,000&deg; F. Generally
speaking, the higher the temperature of pre-heating,
the less the danger of cracking. Preferably, pre-heating
and subsequent slow cooling should be carried
out in a muffle, particularly where light and intricate
castings have to be dealt with.</p>

<p>In all cases care should be taken in the selection
of the proper size of blowpipe tip to be used on any
particular job. Therefore, the size of tip recommended
by the manufacturers should be employed. The total
heat of fusion of cast-iron being high, it is necessary to
use a blowpipe with a greater power than for the same
thickness of welds on mild-steel or wrought-iron. In
the actual operation of welding, the blowpipe flame
should be played on the edges to be welded until the
melting of the iron just takes place. It is essential
to avoid contact of the white cone of the blowpipe
flame with the metal just about to be melted; the
point should be kept at a distance varying from <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> in.
to <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in., according to the thickness of the work. The
two edges to be joined should melt simultaneously. As
soon as the first fusion is obtained, a little flux or
scaling powder must be added; this is usually applied
by dipping the extremity of the welding rod into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page147">[147]</span>
vessel containing the flux, the rod having been previously
heated. Avoid throwing the powder into the
molten metal whilst executing the weld, as the supply
from the welding rod is always sufficient.</p>

<p>Many kinds of fluxes for cast-iron are furnished by
the manufacturers of welding apparatus, which vary
considerably in composition. The principle of all of
them is to provide some chemical which, at the high
temperature involved, will break up the oxide into its
component parts. The following combinations will
perform these functions, and can be recommended:
(1) Boracic acid 80 parts, powdered chlorate of potash
20 parts, ferric carbide 15 parts. (2) Equal parts of carbonate
and bicarbonate of soda, to which is added from
10 to 15 per cent. of borax and 5 per cent. of precipitated
silica. (3) Carbonate of soda 50 per cent. and
bicarbonate of soda 50 per cent. The necessity for using
a flux may not be thoroughly appreciated; but if it
is attempted to weld cast-iron without it difficulty will
at once be experienced.</p>

<p>Do not add any metal from the welding rod until
the bottom of the <span class="symbol">V</span> is filled from the sides. It is
found that by employing silicon in the welding rod, in
the form of ferro-silicon, the iron combines with the
silicon in preference to the carbon, allowing the carbon
to take the form of graphite, and thus facilitate the
formation of grey iron. The welding rod should contain
about 4 per cent. of silicon and as low as possible
in manganese. The purchase of such a welding rod is
not at all difficult, and may be obtained from the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page148">[148]</span>
manufacturers as the flux, from <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> in. to <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. in
diameter.</p>

<p>One criticism of cast-iron welding has been directed
against the hardness of the weld. This hardness may
be due to a number of causes, such as inefficiency of
the operator, unsatisfactory fluxes and welding apparatus,
rapid cooling, etc. Therefore, as stated previously,
in order to get good workable welds, there must be slow
cooling after the welding is complete; and there is no
reason why the worker who carefully follows the instructions
given, and applies himself diligently to the
task, should not be able to weld cast-iron of any thickness
in an efficient and workmanlike manner.</p>

<p>This method of welding cast-iron successfully solves
an unlimited variety of manufacturing and repair problems
in the engineering industry, and can be relied
on to make homogeneous welds on cast-iron. It is impossible
to enumerate in anything like detail all the
work in cast-iron which may be executed by oxy-acetylene
welding; but the following are some of the
applications for which it has already been advantageously
employed: For repairing broken machine
parts, gear boxes, motor cylinders, crank cases, tanks,
manifolds, flywheels, etc., filling blowholes and defects
in castings. Castings impossible or difficult to mould
can be made in parts and united. Teeth broken from
gear wheels can be renewed, and adding metal in any
desired quantity to worn parts of cast-iron articles.
As a concrete example of its economical and positive
aid to the engineering industry, the following may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page149">[149]</span>
of interest. A cast-iron belt-wheel would have gone
on the scrap heap, a total loss, with four of the six
spokes broken, three entirely out. It was 5 ft. in
diameter, and weighed about 500 lb., but was not worth
much as scrap metal. Scrapping it meant the purchase
of a new wheel, and perhaps a long delay in getting
one cast. But with the oxy-acetylene process the
three spokes that were fractured were welded into
place; the fourth spoke broken near the hub was also
welded. There were seven welds, each about 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in.
by 4 in.; the job was done profitably at a cost of &pound;5,
ready for delivery in two days, and was considerably
better than buying a new wheel, and waiting two weeks
or two months for delivery. The process is particularly
suitable for this class of work, and cannot fail to give
satisfaction if performed by an experienced welder.
The cost of welding a given job depends not only on
its thickness, but on the skill of the workman. For
example, the same class of job may vary as much as
50 per cent. if executed by different operators.</p>

<h2><span class="chapno">CHAPTER XVII</span><br />
<span class="chaptitle">Lead Burning</span></h2>

<p>Lead-burning or flaming is the autogenous welding
of lead by means of either an aero-hydrogen or oxy-coal-gas
blowpipe flame. In the past the apparatus
required included a hydrogen-gas generating chamber
(called the &#8220;lead-burning machine&#8221;) and a blower
or air chamber. The hydrogen was made by the action
of dilute sulphuric acid on zinc. That system is now,
or should be, obsolete, having been superseded by the
cleanly and altogether more convenient process of employing
two cylinders, one of compressed coal-gas and
the other of compressed oxygen, in conjunction with an
injector-pattern blowpipe. Gauges and regulators are
required as in the oxy-acetylene process.</p>

<p>The oxy-acetylene process may be successfully
applied to lead-burning in spite of the great heat
of such a flame. The consumption of acetylene,
according to Mr. D. Richardson&#8217;s translation of
Granjon and Rosenberg&#8217;s French work, is only 1 to 2
cubic feet per hour for lead <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> in. to <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> in. thick,
and the process is stated to have &#8220;considerable
advantages over all other methods of autogenous
soldering.&#8221;</p>

<p>In lead-burning it is customary to employ a triangular
stick of refined lead for filling up the seams.<span class="pagenum" id="Page151">[151]</span>
By being burnt or joined together in this way, the lead
becomes homogeneous, and the various parts of it
equally withstand the same chemical action and heat.
For this reason it is used for joining the seams of
chemical and acid tanks, and for the joints of pipes
used for the conveyance of such chemicals. Solder
being an alloy, the acid would have a solvent action on
it, eating it away and rendering it useless, and it would
also give rise to electrical action, practically impossible
when only one metal is exclusively employed. Lead-burning
is also often used on external or roof work.</p>

<p>The seams burnt on sheet-lead are of two kinds:
one forming a butted joint, the other a lapped joint.</p>

<p>In burning a butted seam, the two edges of the lead
to be joined are butted together, and shaved about
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in. to <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> in., or slightly less, on each side. The gas
and oxygen are turned on and adjusted so as to produce
a flame from about 5 in. to 6 in. long, and tapering to
a fine point. The hottest part of the flame is the centre
of the thickest portion, about 1 in. or 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. from the
jet. Hold the jet in the right hand, and a strip of
lead in the left, and allow the flame to play on the
end of the strip, which is held just above the seam.
As the strip melts, the jet is diverted on to the seam
so as to fuse the edges together, the additional lead
forming a thickened portion. The strip is again melted,
and joined to the edges, and also to the thickest part;
and so on along the length. Care should be taken to
burn the lead through, but not for the metal to flow
beneath the seam. After a little practice, the operator<span class="pagenum" id="Page152">[152]</span>
will know exactly when to apply and when to remove
the jet.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig73">Fig. 73</a> shows a flat butted joint partly burnt. The
stick of lead is just nipped with the flame, and a bead
of lead dropped on the seam. The flame is then
directed on to this bead until it is fused with the seam.
When bead and seam are melted together, the flame
is immediately raised. The next bead of lead is then
dropped on the seam so as to half cover the previous
bead, as shown at <span class="smcapall">M</span> (<a href="#Fig73">Fig. 73</a>). The flame is then
directed on the second bead, the flame being immediately
raised after these are fused together, and this
operation is repeated until the whole of the seam is
burnt.</p>

<p>A flat lapped joint, partly burnt, is shown by
<a href="#Fig74">Fig. 74</a>. In burning this joint, the stick of lead is
only required to fill up any irregularities in the burning,
and is not required to form the seam in the same way
as it is in a butted joint, because in lapped burning
the overcloak is burnt down on to the undercloak, as
shown in <a href="#Fig75">Fig. 75</a>. In horizontal and vertical burning,
lapped joints only should be used.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig75">Fig. 75</a> shows a specimen of horizontal or side burning,
and <a href="#Fig76">Fig. 76</a> one of vertical or upright burning. In
burning both of these, the stick of lead is not required
at all, the overcloak being in each case burnt down
on to the undercloak. Care must be taken that both
the overcloak and undercloak of a lapped joint are well
shaved.</p>

<p>The seams should not be soiled or greased, and care
must be taken not to tarnish them in any way. If the
lead is not shaved quite clean, or it becomes tarnished
after it is shaved, it will be found difficult to burn
it together successfully. No tallow or smudge is necessary.
The operator will soon detect the presence of
any foreign substance or dirt on the lead, and the
shavehook should be kept handy to remove it.</p>

<p>In burning a vertical lapped seam, starting at the
bottom, the lapping lead is melted, and as it runs is
turned on to the back portion and fused into it. A
slight projection is formed, which holds the next melting,
and so on, each layer forming a base for the next,
and adding to the height until the top is reached.</p>

<p>In practising either horizontal or vertical burning,
the student should first place his work at an easy angle&mdash;say,
at about 25&deg; or 30&deg;&mdash;gradually raising it as
he becomes proficient until the seam is in a horizontal
or vertical position as desired. Two surfaces
can be burned together in any position&mdash;horizontal,
vertical, or even overhead, where soldering would be
impossible.</p>

<p>Pipe joints can also be made by burning. First
one pipe is opened to form a socket like a slip joint.
The male part, which must enter at least <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in., must
be well shaved and made to fit tight. <a href="#Fig77">Fig. 77</a> shows an
upright joint prepared and partly burnt. <a href="#Fig78">Fig. 78</a> shows
a section of a branch joint as prepared for burning.
Care must be taken to work up a good thick shoulder
for the socket <span class="smcapall">N</span>.</p>

will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
